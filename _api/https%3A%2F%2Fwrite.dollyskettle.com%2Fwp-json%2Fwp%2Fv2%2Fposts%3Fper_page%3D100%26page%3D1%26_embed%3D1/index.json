I ate there often in the 70&#8217;s and my favorite crêpes were their chicken crêpes with a white sauce and ratatouille crepes sprinkled with fresh Parmesan cheese.</p>\n<p>This restaurant is where I got the inspiration for these Chicken and Mushroom Crêpes that I used for dinner parties. I had included the recipe in a little cookbook which I&#8217;d kept that was used for a family political campaign. The other day I was looking through it and realized I&#8217;d forgotten about one of my favorite old recipes. I made it again this week. It was wonderful to once again experience the taste of the chicken, mushrooms and Vermouth filling wrapped in the delicate crêpes with the wonderful sauce.</p>\n<p>There are a number of parts to this recipe. If you have your own crepe and hollandaise recipes that are easy for you to do, use them, following the notes I have made. </p>\n<p>Back in the 70’s, making Eggs Benedict almost every weekend, and making these chicken crêpes, gave me a lot of practice at making hollandaise. When I was researching hollandaise on the internet, I realized that mine recipe was really different. I add tablespoons of hot water at the beginning before slowly pouring in the melted butter. And I make the sauce in a bowl over hot water, like a double boiler. I tried a new popular recipe I found on the internet for hollandaise done with an emulsion hand blender. There was no water added to the egg yolks, just butter. It felt more difficult to me and there was a lot more clean up involved. There are also recipes for a standing blender that look easy but, again, I had trouble. </p>\n<p>But that’s me. I was used to the old way in a double boiler, and adding hat water first and that&#8217;s the way that works for me. But you may may have mastered using a machine. All this is to say use what is easiest for you. Substitute that recipe for the one below. Use 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon in place of what your recipe may calls for and it will taste exactly the same.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3578-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18318\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3578-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3578-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3578-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3578-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3578-scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Chicken and Mushroom Crêpes</h3>\n<p>This recipe makes 30 crêpes, filling for the 30 crêpes and then the sauce for the 30 crêpes. </p>\n<h3>Crêpes</h3>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t looked at any of the recipes or videos on making crêpes but I would think any basic unsweetened recipe for crêpes and any method for cooking them would be fine. If however they don&#8217;t have to tilt the pan to remove excess, the crêpes could be thicker rather than delicate. Also, don&#8217;t let them brown like pancakes. You should be removing them from the pan while they are still white. It only take seconds for these to cook because they are so thin.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3502-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18291\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3502-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3502-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3502.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1 cup water</li>\n<li>1 cup milk</li>\n<li>4 medium eggs</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1/4 cup melted butter, cooled</li>\n<li>2 cups flour</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Place all ingredients in a blender and blend on high for one minute. Refrigerate for 2 hours.<br />\nAfter the 2 hours, heat a small skillet (a heavy stainless steel skillet works well) on medium high. Using a paper towel with some oil or butter on it, rub the hot skillet giving it a little coating of fat. Pour 3 tablespoons of batter into the skillet. As you do this quickly lift the skillet to roll the batter around so that it goes slightly up the sides of the skillet. Then tilt the skillet so the excess runs back into the batter in the blender. Use a table knife to help get the excess out of the skillet while trimming that edge of the crêpe where the excess is pouring out. Return the skillet to the heat. Watch for the edges to start to look cooked and possibly start to separate from the pan. Slip the tip of the knife under the thick side where the excess flowed over, sliding it across to get a flap you can grab with your fingers to flip the crêpe over to the other side.</p>\n<p>The crêpe will cook very quickly. It&#8217;s preferable that it doesn&#8217;t brown as this gives the eggs the same taste if you over cooked your fried eggs. As the skillet continues to heat you will be working faster to get the crêpe flipped over and out of the skillet. The finished crêpes can be stacked right on top of each other on a plate. You will be carefully pulling them off one at a time when it&#8217;s time to fill them. </p>\n<p>You can put the crêpes, filling and sauce in the refrigerator and do the assembling the next day. If you do, cold crêpes will be more stuck together. Before you begin the step of filling them, bring them to room temperature or let them sit a bit so the outsides warm up, then gently pull them off one at a time transferring them to another plate.       </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3457-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18233\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3457-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3457-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3457.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Chicken and Mushroom Filling</h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3465-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18236\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3465-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3465-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3465.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1 8 ounce box (2 cups) finely minced mushrooms</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>\n<li>1/4 cup butter</li>\n<li>1/4 cup finely chopped onions</li>\n<li>salt and pepper</li>\n<li>1/4 cup Vermouth</li>\n<li>8 cups cooked chicken, cut into very small pieces</li>\n<li>1 cup béchamel sauce (see below)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Sprinkle the juice over the mushrooms.

Whisk in the salt and a sprinkle of freshly grated pepper. Remove one cup for the filling and before the mixtures cool cover them with waxed paper to prevent a skin from forming that will make the sauce lumpy.</p>\n<h3>Hollandaise Sauce</h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3490-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18238\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3490-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3490-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3490.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>4 egg yolks</li>\n<li>4 tablespoons hot water</li>\n<li>1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) of butter</li>\n<li>1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Melt the butter in a small pan that works for pouring the butter out without it running down the pan and on the counter. I have a lipped sauce pan that works very well. One with an indentation for pouring is ideal. Test your pots using water. You don&#8217;t want to be in the middle of blending, having to switch the butter to another pan. I set the pan back on the warm burner to keep the melted butter hot as I&#8217;m doing the incorporating. If the butter isn&#8217;t hot enough, the mixture won&#8217;t thicken.</p>\n<p>Place a stainless steal bowl over a pan with simmering water. Place the three yolks in the warm bowl and whisk for 10 seconds. Add the hot water 1 tablespoon at the time. The mixture will become a little frothy but will not thicken yet. After the water is added, begin pouring in the hot butter slowly whisking constantly. When you&#8217;ve added about 1/2 to 3/4&#8217;s of it, the mixture will thicken. If at any time the eggs start to look like they are cooking, quickly remove the bowl from the pan to the counter to cool it down as you continue whisking.</p>\n<p>Whisk in the lemon juice.</p>\n<p>Whisk together the hollandaise, béchamel and heavy cream. The amount of flour in the béchamel can be different depending on how it is measured. If the sauce seems too thick to pour over the crêpes, thin it out with some milk.</p>\n<h3>Assembly</h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3519-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18247\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3519-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3519-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3519.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<p>Fill the 30 crêpes with the chicken mixture, lining them up in casseroles. You can use large casseroles and lay the crepes both directions to fill the dish. In these pictures I have used smaller ones,  2 9&#8243; by 13&#8243;s and 3 9&#8243; by 9&#8243;s, so I can cook and serve the crêpes on different days. Pour the sauce over the crêpes. Bake in a 450 degree oven for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.<br />\nIn the picture they are served with a salad made with butter and green leaf lettuces and a lemon vinaigrette dressing made with 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup lemon juice (or white balsamic vinegar), 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper and 2 teaspoons honey. Shake all ingredients in a jar or salad dressing battle.  </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3527-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18246\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3527-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3527-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3527-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3527-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3527-scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8362-1-770x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18533\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8362-1-770x1024.jpeg 770w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8362-1-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8362-1-768x1022.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8362-1.jpeg 962w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8451-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18524\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8451-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8451-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8451.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8449-769x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18525\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8449-769x1024.jpeg 769w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8449-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8449-768x1023.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8449.jpeg 961w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8446-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18526\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8446-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8446-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8446.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8458-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18530\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8458-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8458-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8458.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8473-770x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"1024\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18531\" /></figure>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Artichoke is a little exotic. You eat it very differently than other vegetables. They are steamed 20 to 40 minutes depending on the size. The ones shown in the pictures are large.</p>\n<p>Begin preparing them by cutting a 1/2 inch off the top and enough off the bottom so that about 3 inches of the heart is exposed.</p>\n<p>If you want to you can cut the sharp tips off the leaves with cooking scissors.</p>\n<p>Place the artichokes on the steam basket over the boiling water and cover. You can check for tenderness by grabbing one with tongs and turning it over and putting a fork in the heart. Another test people use is the leaves should remove easily. In time you&#8217;ll be able to tell just by the very olive color of a cooked artichoke. Transfer the artichoke to a dinner plate with a small bowl or ramekin of either melted butter or mayonnaise.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll only be eating the bottom of the leaves. Starting from the outside of the artichoke, the first rows of leaves are eaten by turning the leaf so the tender side is facing your lower teeth and pressing upper and lower teeth against the leaf as you slide it out, scraping the tender part off into your mouth. About half way through the artichoke, the entire bottom of the leaves will become tender and at one point you can start removing them in bunches by pinching the tops and pulling them off together, and then biting off the entire bottom. When you reach the end of the leaves, scoop off the inedible fuzz with a spoon, being careful not to remove part of the heart. Once the heart is all clean, cut it in bite sized pieces and dip them in the butter or mayonnaise.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3236-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18039\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3236-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3236-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3236-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3236-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3236-scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3244-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18042\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3244-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3244-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3244.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3245-1-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18041\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3245-1-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3245-1-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3245-1-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3245-1-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3245-1-scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>I ran across this recipe in a Fine Cooking magazine and was going to make for Christmas. Instead it just stood it just stood in a pile of recipes because there wasn&#8217;t time to make it. I didn&#8217;t want to file it away and wait until next Christmas. I&#8217;m so glad I didn&#8217;t. Yummy!</p>\n<p>The recipe called for 9 ounces or 2 cups of flour. When I used the 9 ounce weight measurement for the flour, butter from the crust leaked as it began to cook and I had to quickly place a piece of foil on the lower rack. The next time I made it I used the 2 cup measurement and it was much better. I had put a piece of foil directly under the pan just in case and it was the right thing to do. It&#8217;s not unusual to have to do this with spring form and tart pans. To measure the flour, spoon it into the measuring cup. If you scoop the flour using the measuring cup, you will have too much flour. </p>\n<p>The recipe also listed orange zest in the ingredients for the crust which you would then need to chop. Using grated orange rind was fine. Either way would work. </p>\n<p>For the filling, I&#8217;ve been using cognac (a variety of brandy) instead of bourbon (a variety of whiskey). Take your pick.</p>\n<p>Cinnamon was added to the optional whipped cream condiment.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3443-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18202\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3443-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3443-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3443-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3443-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3443-scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Bourbon Pumpkin Tart With Walnut Streusel</h3>\n<h3>Crust</h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3588-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18347\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3588-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3588-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3588.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2 cups flour (spoon the flour into the measuring cup)</li>\n<li>1/3 cup sugar</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon grated orange rind</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1 stick (1/2 cup) plus 3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2&#8243; cubes</li>\n<li>1 large egg, slightly beaten</li>\n<li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Blending pastry ingredients together using your fingers will warm up the butter in the dough. Adding the cream and a whole egg through the tube of a food processor as it&#8217;s running could lead to the butter being over mixed with the flour. For these reasons Fine Cooking has you do it in a standing mixer with the paddle attachment. </p>\n<p>Mix the flour, sugar, grated orange rind, and salt for 30 seconds. Add the butter and combine on low speed for about 3 minutes until the butter pieces are the size of peas. Add the egg and cream and mix on slow speed until the dough is just combined. (Over mixing will make the dough tougher.) Pour out the dough on to a piece of plastic wrap and use the plastic warp to form the dough into a disk about an inch thick. Refrigerate for 1 hour or up to a week.</p>\n<p>When ready to assemble the tart, bring the dough out and set it on a lightly floured pastry mat. If it&#8217;s been in the refrigerator overnight leave it in the plastic wrap let it warm up for 10 minutes or until it&#8217;s pliable. Take it out of the plastic wrap and set the dough on a lightly floured pastry mat.</p>\n<p>Roll the dough out starting from the center and moving to the edge, lifting the dough up and making quarter turns and rolling again from the center out, until it&#8217;s 13 inches in diameter. As you are doing this use as little flour as needed to avoid sticking to the surface and rolling pin and handling the dough as little as possible. Lay the dough over the rolling pin and transfer it to a 11 inch tart pan with removable bottom. Fold the extra length into the sides of the pan making the edges no more than 1/4 inch above with the top of the pan, and about 1/2&#8243; thick. </p>\n<p>Spoon the filling (below) into the crust and sprinkle with the streusel topping (below). Put a piece of foil under the pan or on the rack below to catch any butter drips and bake in a 350 degree oven for 65 to 75 minutes. Cool for 2 hours. Can be refrigerated and then brought back to room temperature or eaten slightly chilled. Serve with whipped cream sprinkled with cinnamon. </p>\n<figure>><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3591-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18345\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3591-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3591-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3591.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Bourbon Pumpkin Filling</h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3393-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"1024\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18213\" /></figure>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1 15 ounce can solid-packed pumpkin (like Libby&#8217;s or Wegman&#8217;s Solid-Packed Pumpkin, not Farmer&#8217;s Market Pumpkin carried by Whole Foods and Sprouts markets)</li>\n<li>3 large eggs</li>\n<li>1/2 cup sugar</li>\n<li>1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons flour</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon cloves</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>\n<li>1/4 cup bourbon (or cognac)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Spoon the pumpkin into a large bowl and whisk in the eggs one at a time until well blended.

It should be a no brainer but turns out it took some time, practice makes perfect, for someone to figure out what method was best. Baked potatoes can explode if you don&#8217;t prick them with a fork. That was one of the first things that someone figured out to do. The old way to cook them was to stick them directly on the oven rack and bake them in a 375 degree oven. Then someone figured out that you could wrap them in foil and get a softer skin. That was a while ago. Then a very lucky cook figured out all the nuances that result in the perfect baked potato and you&#8217;ll find it on a lot of websites at the top of a Google search. Here it is. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3325-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18174\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3325-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3325-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3325-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3325-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3325-scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Perfectly Baked Potatoes</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>medium sized russet potatoes</li>\n<li>avocado oil</li>\n<li>salt</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place a piece of foil on a baking sheet.</p>\n<p>Rinse and scrub potatoes with a vegetable brush. Let them dry. Rub them with avocado oil and sprinkle them all over with salt. Prick in three places with a fork, going in about 1/8 &#8211; 1/4 inch (this keeps the steam from building up and the potato possibly exploding). Set the potatoes on the foil lined pan. You will be setting your timer to go off every 20 minutes so you can flip the potatoes over and move them around for even baking. Bake them in a 425 degree oven for 1 hour or until they can be pressed in easily because they are soft inside. </p>\n<p>If you have different sizes, butt out the smaller ones and let the larger ones cook longer. If the potatoes are extra large in size, bake an additional 15 -20 minutes, then start checking for softness.</p>\n<p>Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Place a piece of butter inside. Serve with sour cream and chives if you like.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3328-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-18175\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3328-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3328-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3328-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3328-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_3328-scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n",

It was so good, I kept going back and never ordered anything else for as long as I lived in Tyler.</p>\n<p>The deli started with removing a jumbo sized russet potato from a warming oven and cutting it in half. It was ten smothered with a butter mixture, then the barbecued beef and topped with cheddar cheese. Lastly, they would run it under a broiler to melt the cheese.</p>\n<p>There are bottled sauces that are really good and many don&#8217;t have any chemicals in them so if you want to save on time just used bottled. Wegman&#8217;s Organic BBQ Sauce Original tastes very much like Jason&#8217;s Deli&#8217;s sauce.  </p>\n<h3>Jason&#8217;s Deli Barbecue Spud</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Easy Pot Roast\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2020/01/25/easy-pot-roast/\">Easy Pot Roast</a></li>\n<li>homemade (see below) or store bought barbecue sauce (Wegman&#8217;s Organic BBQ Sauce Original is good.)</li>\n<li>perfectly baked potatoes (see below)</li>\n<li>salt and pepper</li>\n<li>butter</li>\n<li>grated cheddar cheese</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2855-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17770\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2855-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2855-225x300.jpeg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Follow the directions for Easy Pot Roast (link above).

Place a piece of foil on a baking sheet.</p>\n<p>Rinse and scrub potatoes with a vegetable brush. Let them dry. Rub them with avocado oil and sprinkle them all over with salt. Prick in three places with a fork, going in about 1/8 inch (this keeps the steam from building up and the potato possibly exploding). Set the potatoes on the foil lined pan. You will be setting your timer to go off every 20 minutes so you can flip the potatoes over and move them around for even baking. Bake them in a 425 degree oven for 1 hour or until they can be pressed in easily because they are soft inside. If the potatoes are large, bake an additional 15 -20 minutes, then start checking for softness.  </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0690-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17814\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0690-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0690-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0690.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<figure>\n",

It adds a layer of flavor to the chili powder, beans, meat, and the tomato sauce, making the chili taste richer, offering a complex, as opposed to a simple, appeal to your palate as well as a longer lingering of flavor. You can adjust the amount up to 1 tablespoon per pound of meat keeping in mind that the intention of adding cocoa isn&#8217;t to taste the cocoa itself, but to give the chili multiple dimensions.</p>\n<p>What is also adding to the rich flavor of this recipe is beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, green chilies and Penzey&#8217;s Chili Con Carne seasoning, which, in addition to being chili powder, contains oregano, coriander, red and green bell peppers, black pepper, allspice, cilantro and cloves.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Chili con carne or chilli con carne, meaning &#8216;chili with meat&#8217;, also known as simply chili or chilli, is a spicy stew containing chili peppers, meat, and often tomatoes and beans. Other seasonings may include garlic, onions, and cumin. The original dish originated in southern Texas with working-class Mexican women.&#8221;<br />\nWikipedia</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3116-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17930\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3116-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3116-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3116-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3116-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3116-scaled.jpeg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Chocolate Chili</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1 15 ounce can beef broth</li>\n<li>1 large or 2 medium onions</li>\n<li>3 white carrots</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon avocado oil</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>\n<li>2 pounds ground beef</li>\n<li>2 15 ounce cans mini diced tomatoes</li>\n<li>1 15 ounce tomato sauce</li>\n<li>1 4 ounce can chopped green chilies</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon Hershey&#8217;s unsweetened baking cocoa powder</li>\n<li>3 teaspoons cumin</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons Penzey&#8217;s Chili Con Carne Seasoning</li>\n<li>1 teaspoons paprika</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>\n<li>2 teaspoons salt</li>\n<li>1 can black beans</li>\n<li>1 can pinto or cannelloni beans</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Boil the beef broth in the small pan until it reduces to around a 1/2 cup.

We didn&#8217;t have multi colored carrots back then so it was done with orange carrots, and I only did it as a cake. I was using golden raisins which I&#8217;ve replaced with dates. I hadn&#8217;t tried the recipe in many years and when I did it wasn&#8217;t rising right because of too much sugar so that was fixed.</p>\n<p>The cake version is good with the dates and nuts and doesn&#8217;t need frosting. I think the cupcakes may be better without the nuts and dates and children will probably prefer them without these. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3106-1-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17909\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3106-1-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3106-1-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3106-1.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Beet and White Carrot Cupcakes</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1 cup peeled and grated cooked beets</li>\n<li>2 cups flour</li>\n<li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>\n<li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>3 eggs, separated</li>\n<li>1 cup sugar</li>\n<li>3/4 cup butter, softened</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons water</li>\n<li>1 cup peeled and grated white carrots</li>\n<li>1 cup chopped walnuts (opt.)</li>\n<li>1 cup cut up dates (opt.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>To cook the beets wrap trimmed and washed beets in foil and bake in a 375 degree oven for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>Mix the flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl and set aside.</p>\n<p>In a mixer, beat the egg whites until stiff, transfer to a bowl and set aside.</p>\n<p>Add the sugar and butter to the mixer bowl and beat until fluffy.

For an enchiladas version you can roll up the meat mixture inside corn or flour tortillas and pour a sour cream sauce over top, or to make it simpler, do the tortilla version which is layering the tortillas, meat and cream like you do for a lasagne. Any way you do it, it comes out great.</p>\n<p>I found a recipe years ago in a magazine with green chili salsa instead chopped green chilis, and with this colorful corn and peppers topping. I had thought it was a little dry and added chicken velouté sauce to the original sour cream layer. </p>\n<p>For a large crowd the recipe can be doubled and put into a larger casserole. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3079-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17846\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3079-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3079-225x300.jpeg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Sour Cream Tortilla Casserole</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>3 tablespoons butter</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons flour</li>\n<li>1 14.5 ounce can Swanson&#8217;s Chicken Broth</li>\n<li>2 cups sour cream</li>\n<li>1/2 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese</li>\n<li>2 large chicken breasts</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>\n<li>1 onion, chopped</li>\n<li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon each oil and butter</li>\n<li>1 1/2 teaspoons oregano</li>\n<li>1 1/2 teaspoons cumin</li>\n<li>1 1/2 teaspoons mild chili powder or spice (Penzey&#8217;s 3000 chili spice is good.)</li>\n<li>1/1/2 cups mild green chili salsa</li>\n<li>2 cups fresh corn</li>\n<li>1/4 cup julienned red pepper</li>\n<li>1/4 cup julienned green pepper</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>\n<li>2 cups grated Monterey Jack cheese</li>\n<li>1/4 cup sliced black olives</li>\n<li>9 corn tortillas</li>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Make the sour cream sauce beginning with a chicken velouté sauce.

Cut the roots off the leeks. Cut down the middle and rinse out any dirt between the leaves. Cut off the darker green parts and boil them in the water for 15 minutes. While that is cooking slice the rest of the leeks and prepare all the other ingredients. Remove the darker greens with a slotted spoon and toss. Add all remaining ingredients to the pot, bring to a boil and cook until tender. Remove the bundle of thyme. Cool slightly and blend in batches in a Vita Mix or other blender. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3008-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17831\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3008-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3008-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_3008.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1953.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17982\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1953.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1953-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MG_4899.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17980\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MG_4899.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/MG_4899-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1975.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17983\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1975.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_1975-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Easy Pot Roast was first posted in March of 2014 with the Boursin Mashed Cauliflower recipe, but you won&#8217;t find it there anymore. Pot roast is my favorite meat and I&#8217;ve been discovering over the years that some of the ingredients and steps weren&#8217;t necessary, making the recipe even simpler. I had begun with a recipe in America&#8217;s Test Kitchen&#8217;s Cook&#8217;s magazine that called for a little sugar and both beef and chicken broth. I had been checking on the roast to make sure the liquids were only going two thirds of the way up the roast and removing them when they got too high and keeping that in a measuring cup in the refrigerator until it was time to make the gravy. Also at that time I thought the amount of marbling in the roast made a difference in how tender the roast turned out. But all this has changed.</p>\n<p>Adjusting the recipe reached a point recently where it became so different from the original recipe in Cook&#8217;s magazine that I needed to redo the post with new pictures. America&#8217;s Test Kitchen engineers are brilliant. I knew this when I was doing research for a good gluten free bread recipe and found their trick of using psyllium along with a few other things they did to get a perfect loaf. So the mirepoix flavoring and covering the Dutch oven with foil, before setting lid on, that is in their Cook&#8217;s magazine &#8220;Simple Pot Roast&#8221; recipe, is still part of this recipe and I don&#8217;t plan on experimenting on changing those.</p>\n<p>The experimenting I&#8217;d been doing each time I made a pot roast wasn&#8217;t just about seeing if it could be made quicker and simpler like we like to do with all our recipes. My most recent discovery was being able to cut the time in half, and this alone made the biggest difference, not just in how easy the recipe was becoming, but in tenderness and flavor. In most recipes for pot roasts, &#8216;low and slow&#8217; has been an 8 to 10 hour cooking time. I wasn&#8217;t having a problem with the meat falling apart, or at least I didn&#8217;t think I was, but sometimes it would be too chewy. And I wasn&#8217;t getting consistent results and eventually found it was dependent on the quality and marbling of the roast which is a problem if you want to make a roast and they aren&#8217;t &#8216;good&#8217; that day. I hit a wall when I made the switch to 100% grass fed and I wanted to be able to use 100% grass fed chuck roast but the ones at Whole Foods were not as marbled and so they were turning out consistently too tough and chewy.  </p>\n<p>Recalling that as a teenager I&#8217;d cooked the flatter roasts for only 4 hours at a very low temperature, I decided to experiment with the time and temperature based on what I&#8217;d done then and made an interesting discovery. When you cook the roasts for 8 to 10 hours the meat becomes like the meat still on the bones when you simmer a turkey or chicken carcass in water for long periods of time to make stock. The juiciness is gone leaving the meat dry. And the flavor is virtually gone. It was when I was able to compare a roast cooked 8 to 10 hours to one cooked for 4 hours it gave a new meaning to what &#8216;fork tender&#8217; is. Cutting the time in half (which is still a long time) and finding the right low temperature, made the same considerably less marbled 100% grass fed roasts consistently come out very juicy and tender. Marbling was no longer a consideration and could be removed from the recipe, along with being concerned about the level of liquids. With the changes to &#8216;low and slow,&#8217; following the recipe exactly (I mess up a lot in this area!) a pot roast can be perfect every time. </p>\n<p>(The option of using a bone and water instead of canned beef broth is for those who are doing a strict 100% grass fed diet to avoid chemicals in the grains most cows are fed.) </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2911-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17768\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2911-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2911-225x300.jpeg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<p>Pictured with <a title=\"Creamy Cheesy Scalloped Potatoes\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2020/01/24/creamy-cheesy-scalloped-potatoes/\">Creamy Cheesy Scalloped Potatoes</a> and <a title=\"Blanched Bright Broccoli\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2020/01/25/blanched-bright-broccoli/\">Blanched Bright Broccoli</a></p>\n<h3>Easy Pot Roast</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>4 pound chuck roast</li>\n<li>salt and pepper</li>\n<li>2 tablespoon avocado or other high heat oil</li>\n<li>1/2 normal or 1 small onion, cut in 1/2 inch pieces (about 3/4 cup)</li>\n<li>1 small to medium size carrot, cut in 1/2 inch pieces (about 3/4 cup)</li>\n<li>1 small to medium size celery rib, cup in 1/2 inch pieces (about 3/4 cup)</li>\n<li>2 medium garlic cloves, chopped</li>\n<li>a few sprigs of fresh thyme or rosemary</li>\n<li>1 bay leaf</li>\n<li>1 can Swanson&#8217;s All Natural Beef Broth or 1 beef soup bone and 1 1/2 cups water</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Rinse meat, pat dry with paper towels and salt and pepper all sides.

Pour the water with the florets through a strainer and run the florets under very cold water to stop the cooking. If your tap water isn&#8217;t real cold, you can also remove the florets from the boiling water with a large slotted spoon and transfer them into a bowl of ice water.</p>\n<p>Arrange the florets in a casserole, dot with butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cut out a piece of waxed paper to fit the casserole and lay it on the vegetables. Seal the casserole with foil. (Up to this point can be done ahead of time and refrigerated, then taken out and brought up to room temperature.) Bake in a 350 degree oven for 10 &#8211; 12 minutes or until butter is melted and the broccoli is hot. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2822-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17720\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2822-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2822-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2822.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2832-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17721\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2832-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2832-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2832.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2834-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17722\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2834-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2834-225x300.jpeg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2841-767x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17718\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2841-767x1024.jpeg 767w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2841-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2841-768x1025.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px\" /></figure>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>At the wedding reception of my son Craig to my wonderful daughter-in-law Carrie, the country club served delicious creamy and cheesy scalloped potatoes that I&#8217;ve never forgotten. They were perfect and being able to make scalloped potatoes like theirs has been on my recipe bucket list ever since. </p>\n<p>When I had first made scalloped potatoes decades ago, we were told to make layers of the sliced potatoes, each sprinkled with salt and pepper and flour, and then pour milk over them to nearly cover and dot with butter. After the wedding I did some research and tried a few of the newer recipes where cheese had been added but with no success. I had put the project of reproducing their delicious potatoes aside for a few years.</p>\n<p>Recently I gave it another go. Garlic is found in many of the recipes today but that flavor wasn&#8217;t in the wedding scalloped potatoes. I tried cheddar and mozzarella which most recipes are calling for but the taste wasn&#8217;t right. Most of the recipes are also asking for the potatoes, cheese and milk or cream to be layered which didn&#8217;t look right. The recipes were good but not special. Not unforgettable. Something entirely different was going to be the answer. </p>\n<p>It came to mind that Jarlsberg and parmesan were in my favorite quiche recipe so I decided to try that along with putting the ingredients together an entirely different way that didn&#8217;t involve layering. It worked. Using the right cheeses for the inside and topping, using the right amount of milk vs. cream, the right amount of salt and pepper, along with the new method, made all the difference.</p>\n<p>These scalloped potatoes are heavenly!</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2894-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17739\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2894-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2894-225x300.jpeg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Creamy Cheesy Scalloped Potatoes</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>4 tablespoons butter</li>\n<li>1/2 cup shallots, cut small</li>\n<li>4 tablespoons flour</li>\n<li>2 cups milk</li>\n<li>2 cups heavy cream</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>\n<li>2 cups grated Jarlsberg cheese (don&#8217;t substitute)</li>\n<li>3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/8 inch slices</li>\n<li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Melt butter in a medium saucepan. When hot add the shallots and sauté until translucent. Add the flour to make a roux and stir the roux for 30 seconds with a whisk (this removes the raw flour taste). Gradually whisk in the milk and the cream. Heat until bubbly, whisking occasionally. Add the salt, pepper and Jarlsberg cheese.</p>\n<p>Place the sliced potatoes in a large bowl, pour the cheese sauce over them and mix until they are all coated. Slide the potato mixture into a 9&#8243; by 13&#8243; casserole and arrange the slices  to make the top level. Sprinkle with the parmesan and bake UNcovered in a 375 degree oven for 1 hour. </p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2870-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17744\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2870-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2870-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2870.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2878-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17743\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2878-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2878-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2878.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2880-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17742\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2880-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2880-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2880.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2882-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17741\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2882-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2882-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2882.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2883-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17740\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2883-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2883-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2883.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0684-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17811\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0684-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0684-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0684.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0686-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17809\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0686-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0686-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_0686.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n",

It was a good answer  at the time (and really fun) to needing a low card noodle for meatball lovers. But zucchini zoodles are a bit mushy and leave something to be desired in taste.</p>\n<p>Recently I ran across a recipe using celery root zoodles with a creamy chicken sauce. Setting that recipe aside for the moment, I wanted to see if celery root would be better than the zucchini zoodles with meatballs.</p>\n<p>My old zoodle maker had worn out and I had been on the hunt for a better one until I found a very reputable company had come up with a different design. I bought it and it had been sitting in its box on the shelf for awhile when I ran across the celery root zoodle recipe. I wasn&#8217;t expecting a problem. I made the meatballs and when the ingredients for the &#8216;pasta&#8217; primavera were all ready for the zoodles, I set up the new zoodle maker and cut the celery root to fit the tube that it was to be fed through. But the new design was not right for celery root, and the parts were not heavy duty enough to handle the density of celery root. To be able to continue with the recipe, I decided to just slice the celery root to look like noodles. After sautéing them, I flavored them with the mirepoix and green vegetable that I had ready to turn the &#8216;pasta&#8217; into primavera. It came out great and really pretty. Success!  </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2794-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17676\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2794-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2794-225x300.jpeg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Turkey Meatballs</h3>\n<h5>Ingredients</h5>\n<p>This recipe makes a lot of meatballs.

Then to end it all perfect you need to make homemade turkey soup from scratch with stock made from the turkey carcass.</p>\n<p>For years I&#8217;ve been making the usual turkey soup with a lot of different vegetables but I was introduced to something very different by my son when I visited with his family for Thanksgiving this year — a wonderful yet simple, mirepoix (onion, carrot and celery) flavored, sweet potato version of turkey soup. It was pure holiday comfort food! So good! </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_2703-2-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17548\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_2703-2-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_2703-2-225x300.jpeg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Richard&#8217;s Turkey and Sweet Potato Soup</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2 yellow onions (non-sweet onions), diced (about 3 cups)</li>\n<li>2 garlic bulbs, peeled and chopped small</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons avocado oil</li>\n<li>turkey stock (recipe below)</li>\n<li>1 medium sized head of celery, sliced in small pieces (about 5 cups)</li>\n<li>1 pound carrots, sliced in small pieces (about 3 cups)</li>\n<li>2 to 3 sweet potatoes, cut off and peel blemishes and rough spots then cut in 3/4&#8243; pieces (about 7 cups)</li>\n<li>1 rosemary sprig</li>\n<li>1 bay leaf</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>\n<li>leftover roasted turkey</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Sauté the onions and garlic in the butter and oil for 10 minutes on medium high. The mixture will begin to brown. Add the celery and carrots and sauté another 10 minutes. Add the stock, sweet potatoes, rosemary, bay leaf and salt. Bring to boil and turn heat down and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Remove bay leaf and rosemary stem. </p>\n<h4>Turkey Stock</h4>\n<h5>Ingredients</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>1 turkey carcass</li>\n<li>1 large onion, cut into 4 wedges (leave the peel on)</li>\n<li>4 stalks celery, cut into 4&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>4 carrots, cut into 4&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>2 bay leaves</li>\n<li>several springs of fresh thyme</li>\n<li>12 peppercorn</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Instructions</h5>\n<p>Place turkey carcass in a large stock pot and cover with water. Add vegetables, bay leaves and salt. Bring to boil, turn down heat and simmer for 4 hours. Cool, remove the bones and vegetables and strain. Refrigerate overnight to make it easier to remove the fat. The fat will have risen to the top and the stock will have a lot of gelatin from the bones and will be very jello like making it easy to skim off the fat. I like to use a thin metal cookie spatula.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_2662-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17531\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_2662-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_2662-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_2662.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_9287-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17555\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_9287-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_9287-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_9287.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0171-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17559\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0171-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0171-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0171.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0172-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"1024\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17560\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0225-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17562\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0225-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0225-225x300.jpeg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0287-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"1024\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17566\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0227-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17564\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0227-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0227-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0227.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_9334-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17568\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_9334-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_9334-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_9334.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>This is a pumpkin spice, cranberry-ginger, and bourbon pecan three layered cake with light lemony cream cheese icing that is pure holiday comfort food. It makes a lot so it&#8217;s great for a holiday party at home or to bring the taste of the holidays to the office. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been looking forward to making this beautiful cake since I ran across the recipe in the &#8220;Your Best Thanksgiving&#8221; section of the November of 2018 issue of <em>Women&#8217;s Day</em> that I picked up at the airport when traveling to be with family last year for the holidays. The cake was called &#8220;Thanksgiving Cake,&#8221; but  both my daughter-in-law and I felt like the bourbon and gingerbread like flavors were more like Christmas, and it could also be a showy dessert (like English Trifle) for New Year&#8217;s Eve. So I felt the the name needed to be changed to a holiday cake.</p>\n<p>In making it, I had difficulty with the icing part of the original recipe, and was wondering if it was a mistake when it asks us to whip five 8 ounce packages of cream cheese plus 1 1/2 cups unsalted butter, then add 5 teaspoons of lemon juice and 3 cups of powdered sugar. I &#8216;whipped it until smooth and fluffy&#8217; as the recipe instructed and ended up with double the amount of icing I needed, and it was too light and fluffy to remain between the layers of cake, and it also would have just slid off the top and outside the cake. So I did some measuring and turned part of it into a basic cream cheese frosting by adding the appropriate amount of powdered sugar. The taste of the original &#8216;very cream cheesy&#8217; icing was delicious and a distinctly holiday taste, so I think the ingredients were accurate. I believe the problem with the recipe may have been that the cream cheese and butter should not have been whipped until fluffy, just slowly mixed together until fully blended. That way no volume would be added and it would remain stiff enough. But in comparing the two flavors, the &#8216;taste testing team&#8217; here preferred the basic sugary cream cheese icing over the lightly sweetened cream cheese icing, I opted to not redo the original icing recipe to see if I could get it to come out the right consistency for spreading.</p>\n<p>The original recipe also called for 1 1/4 tablespoons pumpkin pie spice in the pumpkin layer. Pumpkin pie spice can be any number of combinations of the classic spices — cardamon, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, allspice, nutmeg — so do your own thing. </p>\n<p>Use <a title=\"Cake Strips\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/4-Piece-Absorbent-Prevents-Crowning-Professional/dp/B07QCTB5LW/ref=asc_df_B07QCTB5LW/?tag=hyprod-20&#038;linkCode=df0&#038;hvadid=343276570520&#038;hvpos=1o1&#038;hvnetw=g&#038;hvrand=9126821705408095104&#038;hvpone=&#038;hvptwo=&#038;hvqmt=&#038;hvdev=c&#038;hvdvcmdl=&#038;hvlocint=&#038;hvlocphy=9007576&#038;hvtargid=pla-752344743074&#038;psc=1&#038;tag=&#038;ref=&#038;adgrpid=73031402310&#038;hvpone=&#038;hvptwo=&#038;hvadid=343276570520&#038;hvpos=1o1&#038;hvnetw=g&#038;hvrand=9126821705408095104&#038;hvqmt=&#038;hvdev=c&#038;hvdvcmdl=&#038;hvlocint=&#038;hvlocphy=9007576&#038;hvtargid=pla-752344743074\">cake strips</a> if you have them, or <a title=\"make cake strips\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNuAMoMgq70&#038;t=182s\">make your own</a> so the cakes come out level and not crowned/domed.</p>\n<p>Do not overcook the cakes or you will have dry cakes with a lot less flavor. Get some toothpicks or use your finger to test for doneness right at the first listed time. All of mine needed the additional 5 minutes but your oven may cook hotter. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2534-1-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17425\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2534-1-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2534-1-225x300.jpeg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Holiday Three Flavor Cake</h3>\n<p>You will need 3 9&#8243; cake pans lined with waxed or parchment paper and buttered and floured. Turn a pan over and cut the three liners. Butter all the pans and add the liners, then butter the liners. Then add a tablespoon of flour to a pan and turn the pan until all the bottom and sides are lightly coated, then dump the remaining flour in the next pan adding more flour. Continue until all the pans are coated, turning the pans upside down and bagging then against the side of the sink to remove excess flour. </p>\n<h3>Pumpkin Spice Cake</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2 cups flour</li>\n<li>2/3 cup sugar</li>\n<li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>\n<li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon cinnamon</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon ginger</li>\n<li>3/4 teaspoon cloves</li>\n<li>3/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon allspice</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1 cup canned solid-packed pumpkin (like Libby&#8217;s or Wegman&#8217;s Solid-Packed Pumpkin, not Farmer&#8217;s Market Pumpkin carried by Whole Foods and Sprouts markets)</li>\n<li>2/3 cup packed light brown sugar</li>\n<li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>\n<li>2/3 cup olive oil</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Place the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, spices and salt in a bowl and whisk together. In a mixing bowl, mix the pumpkin puree, light brown sugar, eggs, vanilla and olive oil. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet whisking just until smooth. Transfer to prepared pan and bake in a 350 degree oven for 35 &#8211; 40 minutes or until it springs back or the toothpick comes out clean. Cool on a cookie rack for 10 minutes, then invert (loosening around the edges with a knife if necessary), remove waxed paper/parchment, and let cool completely, then wrap in plastic wrap to keep from drying out. </p>\n<h3>Bourbon Pecan Cake</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1 1/2 cup flour</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1/4 cup molasses</li>\n<li>1/4 cup dark corn syrup</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons bourbon (you can buy this in very small bottles that have about 1/4 cup in them)</li>\n<li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsweetened butter, room temperature</li>\n<li>1 cup packed dark brown sugar</li>\n<li>3 large eggs, room temperature</li>\n<li>1/2 cup buttermilk, room temperature</li>\n<li>2 cups pecans, chopped</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Place the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl and whisk together.

Beat in the molasses mixture and stir in the pecans. Transfer the batter to prepared pan and bake in a 350 degree oven for 40 &#8211; 45 minutes or until it springs back when you touch the center with your finger or a toothpick comes out clean. Cool on a cookie rack for 10 minutes, then invert (loosening around the edges with a knife if necessary), remove waxed paper/parchment, and let cool completely, then wrap in plastic wrap to keep from drying out. </p>\n<h3>Cranberry Ginger Cake</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1 1/2 cup flour</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>6 tablespoons unsweetened butter, room temperature</li>\n<li>1 cup sugar</li>\n<li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>\n<li>3/4 cup buttermilk, room temperature</li>\n<li>8 ounces fresh or thawed frozen cranberries</li>\n<li>1/2 cup chopped candied ginger</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Place the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl and whisk together.

Cool on a cookie rack for 10 minutes, then invert (loosening around the edges with a knife if necessary), remove waxed paper/parchment, and let cool completely, then wrap in plastic wrap to keep from drying out.</p>\n<h3>Cream Cheese Icing with Lemon</h3>\n<p>Have the cream cheese and butter both at room temperature or they will have to be whipped too much to get them blended. </p>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>3/4 cup butter, softened</li>\n<li>2 8 ounce boxes cream cheese, softened</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>\n<li>8 &#8211; 9 cups powdered sugar (Adjust the amount of powdered sugar to have the right consistency for icing a cake.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Place cream cheese and butter in mixer bowl and whip until well blended. Add the lemon juice and sugar and blend. Don&#8217;t over whip and add a lot of volume. </p>\n<p>Slice cake and serve with a dollop of whipped cream sprinkled with nutmeg.</p>\n<figure>\n<img

      "rendered": "<p>Coq au vin or &#8216;rooster with wine&#8217; is a classic French stew in which chicken is braised slowly in red wine and cognac or brandy, bits of bacon, fresh thyme, mushrooms, carrots, garlic and onions. Originally the dish was engineered to cook adult male chickens or roosters. The young male cockerels that grow up and become roosters that &#8220;cock a doodle doo,&#8221; have tough meat and the acid in the wine tenderizes it. Most modern recipes are done with the female chickens or hens, the normal chicken you find in the store, which is already tender if cooked properly. So using wine results in very tender, juicy meat and a very tasty sauce. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Julia Child included coq au vin in her 1961 cookbook <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em>, and she prepared it twice on the PBS cooking show The French Chef. This exposure helped to increase the visibility and popularity of the dish in the United States, and {like her Boeuf Bourguignon} coq au vin was seen as one of Child&#8217;s signature dishes.&#8221; Wikipedia</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll find recipes with dry white wine has been substituted for the red. The cognac and brandy are said to be optional. Some add bay leaves and parsley. One chef adds Herbs de Provence along with the thyme. Shallots can be used in place of the onion. </p>\n<p>The first time I made it for us, it was agreed that having to deal with bones and skin and cartilage getting lost in the sauce isn&#8217;t ideal. I also felt like there was too much sauce for the amount of meat especially if you were serving over mashed potatoes and not serving it in bowls and eating it like a stew. To solve this second problem I added additional chicken pieces. For the first issue, I decided to &#8216;color outside the lines&#8217; a little, and, breaking with the tradition at the point where the chicken pieces are removed and the sauce is gently simmering so it reduces and thickens, I removed the bones and skin before returning the chicken to the pot along with the prepared mushrooms, pearl onions and the &#8216;beurre mania&#8217; at which point it simmers another 10 minutes to continue thickening the sauce. The classic presentation of whole chicken pieces a top a mound of vegetables or mashed potatoes with leg bones sticking up, is lost but it&#8217;s still a completely delicious looking dish.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2507-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17312\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2507-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2507-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2507.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Coq Au Vin</h3>\n<h4>Chicken Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>6 slices of bacon, sliced in 1/2&#8243; strips</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon avocado oil (better for high heat than olive oil)</li>\n<li>4 pounds chicken parts (i.e., 6 &#8211; 8 thighs/legs (depending on size), and 2 breasts</li>\n<li>1 cup sliced carrots</li>\n<li>1 onion, cut in quarters and sliced</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>\n<li>4 cloves garlic, sliced or smashed (Lay the blade of a large knife over a clove and press down with the palm of your hand, remove skin and roughly chop.)</li>\n<li>1/4 cup French Cognac</li>\n<li>2 cups French Pinot Noir</li>\n<li>1 14.5 ounce Swanson&#8217;s Chicken Broth, divided</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>\n<li>5 springs of fresh thyme, tied in a bundle with kitchen string</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons white flour or tapioca flour</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons butter, at room temperature</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>It is recommended that you use the French practice of &#8216;mise en place&#8217; which means to have all the ingredients prepared and ready to go before you start the cooking.

I&#8217;ve made a habit of always doing &#8216;mise en place&#8217; because it makes cooking more enjoyable for me, but it&#8217;s especially good to do it for more complex recipes that have a lot of steps to them.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2427-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17314\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2427-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2427-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<p>Preparation:</p>\n<p>Slice the bacon.</p>\n<p>Rinse and dry the chicken and sprinkle it with salt and pepper.</p>\n<p>Cut up the carrots, the onion and the garlic.</p>\n<p>Have the tomato paste measured in a spoon or small dish.</p>\n<p>Tie up the sprigs of thyme.</p>\n<p>Place the 3 tablespoons of butter along side the flour on a small plate to come to room temperature so you can combine them with a fork (If you are using tapioca flour/starch, it can get messy and you may prefer a bowling a spoon to keep the starch contained.)</p>\n<p>Wash and trim the mushrooms, leaving some of the stem, and cut them in half.</p>\n<p>To peel the pearl onions, cut off each end and place them in boiling water for 30 seconds and then plunge them into ice water to completely stop the cooking. Make a slit down one side with a paring knife and slip them out of the outer skin.</p>\n<p>Lastly, measure the wine and cognac into measuring cups. Pour 1/2 cup of the chicken broth into a measuring cup and set aside for the pearl onions. </p>\n<p>Sometime during the preparations, preheat your oven to 325 degrees. And heat a large dutch oven or large heavy skillet over medium high. </p>\n<p>Cooking: </p>\n<p>When everything is ready and pot/skillet is hot, add the avocado oil to the pot and then the bacon. Cook the bacon until it starts to get crispy, tilt the pan and gather the pieces at the top end and remove them to a medium sized bowl. Add half of the chicken pieces, skin side down, and brown each side for about 5 minutes and remove to the bowl with the bacon. Repeat with the rest of the chicken pieces. Remove the chicken and add the onions, carrots, salt and pepper and cook them for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned.</p>\n<p>Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Pour in the cognac, wine, the chicken stock in the can (about 1 1/4 cups) and the tomato paste. Stir to combine. Add the bundled thyme, cooked chicken pieces and bacon along with any juices in the bowl. Bring to a simmer, cover with foil. Bake in the oven for 1 hour. </p>\n<p>While the chicken is cooking, cook the onions and mushrooms.     </p>\n<h4>Onion Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>10 ounces pearl onions, skins removed</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>\n<li>1/2 cup chicken stock</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Following the instructions above for peeling the onions and below for cooking them, you should have a nice presentation of whole (not falling apart), fully cooked onions.</p>\n<p>Heat the butter and oil in a 8&#8243; enamel pot on medium hight. Add the onions and lightly brown. Add the 1/2 cup broth and herbs. Bring to a boil, turn heat down and simmer uncovered for 30 &#8211; 40 minutes. There should be a couple tablespoons of the juices left. </p>\n<h4>Mushroom Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>8 ounces mushrooms, cut in half</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Heat the butter and oil in a large heavy bottomed skillet (a scan pan works great). Add the mushrooms and cook until they have shrunk to half their original size and are browned. Remove to a plate or add to the cooling onions.</p>\n<p>When the chicken in done, remove it to the stove and turn on the heat. Using tongs transfer the chicken pieces to the bowl. You&#8217;re going to boil the sauce gently for about 10 minutes. At this point you can remove the skin and bones from the chicken pieces if you want to. After the sauce has been boiled, add the chicken back into the sauce along with the onions and mushrooms and stir in the flour and butter mixture. Let this cook and thicken for about 10 minutes (longer is okay). Remove from heat, cool and refrigerate.</p>\n<p>The next day, reheat and serve with mashed potatoes and braised vegetable roots (recipe below).</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2461-2-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17316\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2461-2-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2461-2-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2439-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17332\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2439-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2439-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2439-1.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Braised Root Vegetables</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>\n<li>10 small carrots, 1 inch top left on, peeled</li>\n<li>8 Hakurei turnips or other small turnip, cut in half or quarters</li>\n<li>1 small green or purple kohlrabi, peeled and sliced and cut in strips or cubes</li>\n<li>1 parsnip, peeled and sliced and cut in pieces if slices are large</li>\n<li>salt and pepper</li>\n<li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Heat oil and butter in a medium size pot over medium high heat.

      "rendered": "<p>The movie <em>Julia &#038; Julia</em> is about a young woman Julia Powell blogging her journey as she leaves work at the end of each day and is spending her evenings cooking her way through every recipe from cover to cover in Julia Child&#8217;s (her idol) <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em>. The movie switches back and forth between Julia, the blogger, in the present and Julia Child in France taking classes and how she came to write her cookbooks. I highly recommend the movie. It&#8217;s darling!</p>\n<p>Julia Child&#8217;s famous recipe for Boeuf Bourguignon is featured in the movie. As the story goes you learn that the reason Julia Child wrote her highly respected and popular books was to simplify French cooking for the rest of us lay cooks. There are a number of versions of her famous dish on the internet, some have made changes to the ingredients, other recipes were created using less steps and less pots for those with time constraints. But if you have the time, and want to be more authentically Julia, it&#8217;s not really a lot of trouble to do them all (per her goal of making French cooking relatively easy!).</p>\n<p>Doing it Julia&#8217;s way, you&#8217;ll be cooking the beef, the buttery pearl onions and the mushrooms separately, and then combining the three and pouring the strained sauce (boiled down if necessary) over them.</p>\n<p>Use a good burgundy or Pinot Noir wine. It doesn&#8217;t have to be expensive. I found a French Pinot Noir on sale for $9.99 at Total Wine or More. The European wines are processed in a more natural way and have less sulfites which are known to cause some people to get headaches. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_2311-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17216\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_2311-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_2311-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Boeuf Bourguignon</h3>\n<h4>Beef Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>6 slices of bacon, cut in 1/2&#8243; strips</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon olive or avocado oil</li>\n<li>2 pounds stew meat or chuck roast cut in 1 1/2&#8243; pieces (You&#8217;ll be starting with a bigger roast to get the 2 pounds once the fat is removed.)</li>\n<li>1 cup sliced carrots (2 small)</li>\n<li>1 1/2 cup sliced yellow onion (cut in quarters and sliced)</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons white flour or tapioca flour</li>\n<li>1 1/2 cups French Pinot Noir, a dry red wine from Burgundy</li>\n<li>2 14.5 ounce Swanson&#8217;s Beef Broth boiled down to 2 cups (use 1/2 cup for pearl onions)</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>\n<li>2 cloves garlic, smashed (Lay the blade of a large knife over a clove and press down with the palm of your hand, remove skin, roughly cut.)</li>\n<li>5 sprigs fresh thyme, tied in a bundle with kitchen string</li>\n<li>2 bay leaves</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>It is recommended that you use the French practice of &#8216;mise en place&#8217; which means to have all the ingredients prepared and ready to go before you start the cooking. It allows you to concentrate on the cooking and removes a lot of stress, you won&#8217;t over cook something or miss a step or an ingredient. I&#8217;ve made a habit of always doing &#8216;mise en place&#8217; because it makes cooking more enjoyable for me, but it&#8217;s especially good to do it for more complex recipes that have a lot of steps to them.  </p>\n<p>Preparation: Start the beef stock boiling down. Slice the bacon. Have the meat cut, if necessary, and patted dry so it will brown. Cut up the carrots and the onion. Have the tomato paste measured in a spoon or small dish.  Smash and cut the garlic. Tie up the sprigs of thyme and set the bay leaves on the bundle. Measure the salt and pepper and the flour. Wash and trim the mushrooms, leaving some of the stem, and cut them in half or quarters depending on size. To peel the pearl onions, cut off each end and place them in boiling water for 30 seconds and then plunge them into ice water to completely stop the cooking. If they don&#8217;t pop out of the skins when you squeeze them, make a slit down one side with a paring knife and slip them out of the outer skin. Lastly, measure the wine. Pour 1/2 cup of the beef stock into a measuring cup and set aside for the pearl onions.</p>\n<p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Heat a large dutch oven (Le Creuset size 28 &#8211; 6.25 quart) on medium high heat and add the oil and then the bacon pieces and cook until they are lightly browned, stirring often. Tilt the pan and move all the pieces towards the upended side, pressing the grease out of the pieces and then scooping them up and placing them in a large bowl.  Place half of the beef pieces in the pot, brown on both sides, removed to the bowl with the bacon. Let any liquid in the pot cook down and then repeat with the remaining beef pieces. Add the carrots and onions to the pot and cook 5 minutes until browned, stirring a few times. Return beef and bacon to the pot, sprinkle with the salt and pepper, then sprinkle with the flour and stir. Place the pot uncovered in the oven for 4 minutes. Stir and then cook for 4 minutes more. Remove the pot from the oven. Turn the temperature down to 225 degrees. Add the wine and 1 1/2 cups of the beef broth to the pot. Stir in the tomato paste and add the thyme, bay leaves, and garlic. Cover the pot tightly and cook for 3 hours.</p>\n<p>While meat is cooking, prepare the onions and mushrooms. When meat is tender, remove the meat and carrot slices from the pot using tongs. Strain the juices, pressing the vegetables to remove all the juice. The juices should measure about 1 3/4 cups and be like thickened sauce. If the juice hasn&#8217;t become a thick sauce during the cooking process, boil it down to thicken it. Combine the meat, mushrooms and onions and pour over the sauce. The dish will be a very rich, dark color. (My pictures have been lightened so you can see the ingredients.) </p>\n<p>Serve with <a href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2019/09/06/grandmas-mashed-potatoes/\">mashed potatoes</a>  or mashed cauliflower for low carb or paleo, sprinkled with fresh thyme leaves.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_2273-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17178\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_2273-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_2273-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_2273.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h4>Onion Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>8 ounces pearl onions, pealed</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>\n<li>2 tablespoon olive or avocado oil</li>\n<li>1/2 cup beef broth (from above)</li>\n<li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>\n<li>2 sprigs fresh parsley</li>\n<li>half of a bay leaf or small bay leaf</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Following the instructions above for peeling the onions and below for cooking them, you should have a nice presentation of whole (not falling apart), fully cooked onions.</p>\n<p>To peel the pearl onions, cut off each end and place them in boiling water for 30 seconds and then plunge them into ice water to completely stop the cooking.

The principal use of the cotton pinafore was to protect the dress underneath because a woman often had very few. It was also easier to launder aprons than dresses.</p>\n<p>An apron served as a potholder for removing hot pans from the oven. It was wonderful for blotting children&#8217;s tears. From the chicken coop, an apron was a pouch for carrying eggs, fussy chicks and sometimes half-hatched eggs headed to a warming oven. </p>\n<p>When company came, those aprons were ideal hiding places for shy kids. When the weather turned cold, Grandmother would wrap it around her chilled arms. Those big old aprons mopped many a perspiring brow, whether bent over a hot wood stove or picking snap peas in the garden. Her apron served as a carrier for kindling and wood chips brought into the kitchen to stoke the fire. From the garden, it carried the fresh vegetables. After the peas had been shelled, it carried out the hulls.</p>\n<p>Come Autumn, the apron bundled the apples indoors for preparing apple butter and pies. Then unexpected company drove up the road, it was surprising how much furniture that old apron could dust in a matter of seconds. Toys and shoes where toted to bedrooms in it as well.</p>\n<p>When dinner was ready, Grandmother walked out onto the porch and waved her apron as an alert to the menfolk to come in from the fields for her buttery biscuits.</p>\n<p>Times have changed. While Grandmother once set her hot baked pies in the window sill to cool, her granddaughters set their&#8217;s out to thaw. There are many cooks today that would fret over the stains and germs on Grandmother&#8217;s apron&#8230; but it is doubtful that anyone caught anything from her apron but love.</p>\n<p>This poem Grandmother&#8217;s Apron is often listed as &#8220;Author Unknown&#8221; but the original version was written by <a href=\"http://www.withagratefulheart.com/2007/07/grandmas-apron.html\">Tina Trivett</a>. </p>\n",

If you want the added tenderness from brining, and the added flavor of herbs and you don&#8217;t mind taking the extra time to do these extra things. But as the say goes, &#8220;you can&#8217;t make a good omelet out of bad eggs.&#8221; So for a delicious turkey, it needs to be a quality bird cooked to exactly 160 degrees internally. The latter two things are the basics and the rest is the frill for the &#8216;foodie&#8217; cooks we&#8217;ve become.</p>\n<p>To cook a turkey perfectly, if you have a probe in your oven, use it even if your turkey has a pop up. If you don&#8217;t, you can buy a device with a read out that sets on your counter attached to probes in the turkey in the oven. Like an oven probe, these probe devices have an alarm that goes off at 160 degrees and if you look for them you can find one that even syncs to your apple watch so you can be off busy doing something else. Using a probe, you are sure to get the turkey out at just the right moment. And doing it this way you aren&#8217;t opening the oven up and releasing the heat and slowing the cooking time, possibly burning yourself and poking extra holes in the turkey. Turkey&#8217;s with butter all over them don&#8217;t need to be basted so there&#8217;s no opening the door for that reason either.</p>\n<p>For the second basic, to get a good turkey, pass by the ones in the bins, where&#8217;s it&#8217;s like picking out a watermelon wishing you could see and taste the hidden inside, and talk to a butcher about the best options. I did this at Whole Foods this year and he went to the chilled room and brought back a turkey in clear wrap without fancy name or description on it. I was able to see that the turkey was unblemished and fresh looking, and the price was a little less than the ones in the bins. It turned out to be a really good turkey, just like he told me it would be.<br />\nThe brining recipe below was adapted from <a href=\"https://www.afamilyfeast.com/turkey-brine-recipe/\">afamilyfeast.com</a></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0126m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15106\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0126m.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_0126m-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<p><center>Menu</center><br />\n<center><a title=\"Aunt Chris' Holiday Salad\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2011/06/08/aunt-chris-holiday-salad/\">Aunt Chris&#8217; Holiday Salad (With Peach Dressing)</a> or <a title=\"Fresh Strawberry and Pear Salad\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2011/06/21/strawberry-pear-salad/\">Fresh Strawberry and Pear Salad (With Strawberry Dressing)</a> or <a title=\"Holiday Fruit Salad\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2013/11/13/holiday-fruit-salad/\">Holiday Fruit Salad</center><br />\n<center><a title=\"Butter Monkey Bread\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2018/12/05/butter-monkey-bread/\">Butter Monkey Bread</a></center><br />\n<center>Holiday Roast Turkey (recipe below)</center><br />\n<center>Gravy (recipe below)</center><br />\n<center>Ocean Spray Cranberry Sauce or<br />\n<a title=\"Cranberry Sauce and Pear Apple Chutney\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2011/11/20/cranberry-and-pear-apple-chutney/\">Cranberry Sauce or Cranberry Pear Apple Chutney</a></center><br />\n<center><a title=\"Chestnut and Mushroom Stuffing\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2019/09/06/chestnut-and-mushroom-stuffing/\">Chestnut and Mushroom Stuffing</a></center><br />\n<center><a title=\"Grandma's Mashed Potatoes\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2019/09/06/grandmas-mashed-potatoes/\">Grandma&#8217;s Mashed Potatoes</a></center><br />\n<center><a title=\"Party Potatoes\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2019/09/06/party-potatoes/\">Party Potatoes</a></center><br />\n<center><a title=\"\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2019/09/06/sweet-potatoes-with-roasted-pear-sauce/\">Sweet Potatoes With Roasted Pear Sauce</a> or<br />\n<a title=\"Scalloped Yams With Maple Orange Sauce\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2011/12/20/scalloped-yams-with-maple-orange-sauce/\">Scalloped Yams With Maple Orange Sauce</a></center><br />\n<center><a title=\"Creamy Brussels Sprouts With Bacon\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2019/09/06/creamy-brussels-sprouts-with-bacon/\">Creamy Brussels Sprouts With Bacon</a></center><br />\n<center><a title=\"Green Bean Casserole With Crispy Shallots\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2019/09/06/green-bean-casserole-with-crispy-shallots/\">Green Bean Casserole With Crispy Shallots</a></center><br />\n<center><a title=\"Broccoli Casserole With Bread Crumb Topping\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2019/09/06/broccoli-casserole-with-bread-crumb-topping/\">Broccoli Casserole With Bread Crumb Topping</a></center><br />\n<center><a title=\"Honey Butter Glazed Carrots\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2019/09/06/honey-butter-glazed-carrots/\">Honey Butter Glazed Carrots</a></center><br />\n<center><a title=\"Fresh Corn Spoon Bread\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2019/08/23/fresh-corn-spoon-bread/\">Fresh Corn Spoon Bread</a></center><br />\n<center><a title=\"Pumpkin Pie With Maple Syrup\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2011/11/23/pumpkin-pie-maple-syrup/\">Pumpkin Pie With Maple Syrup</a></center><br />\n<center><a title=\"Pecan Pie\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2011/11/23/pecan-pie/\">Pecan Pie</a></center></p>\n<figure></figure>\n<h4>Holiday Roast Turkey</h4>\n<h3>Brine</h3>\n<p>For a 20 lb turkey (adjust for smaller turkeys):</p>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2 carrots, scrubbed and cut in 3 to 4&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>2 celery stalks, cut in 3 to 4&#8243;pieces</li>\n<li>1 medium onion, cut in quarters</li>\n<li>1 quart plus a cup of water</li>\n<li>1 cup kosher salt or 3/4 cup table salt</li>\n<li>6 sage leaves</li>\n<li>2 large sprigs of thyme</li>\n<li>1 large sprig of rosemary</li>\n<li>2 bay leaves</li>\n<li>3 garlic cloves, smashed</li>\n<li>peel of one orange</li>\n<li>1 large apple, sliced</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon peppercorns</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon whole allspice</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon juniper berries (Frontier Coop at Whole Foods)</li>\n<li>1 gallon of water</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Make a vegetable broth by boiling the carrots, celery and onion for 30 minutes, strain. Place all ingredients including the vegetable broth in a large pot. Bring to boil and boil for 3 minutes. Cool.<br />\nRemove the neck and gizzards from the turkey and clean it inside and out and dry it with paper towels. Put the turkey in a Reynold&#8217;s turkey bag and place it in a bucket. Add cool brine plus another gallon of water. Place in the fridge. (Because of the weight, to make it easier I like to put the bucket with the turkey in the fridge before adding the liquid.) Brine for 12 hours. Remove the turkey from the brine and rinse and dry it. Loosen the skin over the breasts and thighs. Set the turkey in a pan in the refrigerator uncovered several hours or overnight so the skin dries. This is so the herbed butter can stick well and the turkey will have a beautiful golden skin.</p>\n<p>If the turkey came with a neck, place it in a sauce pan and cover with enough water to end up with about 2 cups liquid. Bring to boil, then simmer 30 minutes. Cool and put in the fridge. You will add this to the bottom of the roasting pan with vegetables to flavor the juices. (If you are using a roasting rack, you can just place the neck in the roasting pan.)</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_6890.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15234\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_6890.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_6890-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_9008-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17098\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_9008-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_9008-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_9008.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Herbed Butter</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1 cup butter, softened</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage</li>\n<li>3 garlic cloves, crushed</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Place all the ingredients on a plate and mix with a fork. Put on plastic wrap and mold into a log. Chill. </p>\n<p>You will be slicing the log and slipping the pieces of herbed butter under the loosened skin of the turkey and using part of it to cover the outside of the turkey.</p>\n<h3>Flavoring for Pan Juices</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2 carrots, cut in half and in half again, then cut in 4&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>2 celery ribs, cut in half, then in 4&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>1 large onion, skin on, washed, left whole</li>\n<li>4 garlic cloves, smashed</li>\n<li>a small handful of fresh thyme tied with twine</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Place in a large baggie. Have this ready the night before. In the morning, cut the onion into wedges. </p>\n<h3>Cooking the Turkey</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2 onions, peeled, cut in half</li>\n<li>6 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>The day you are cooking the turkey, remove the turkey from the refrigerator. Place the bag of vegetables and thyme in the roasting pan. Place the turkey on top of the vegetables. Cut 3/4 cup of the herbed butter into slices and allow the remaining 1/4 cup to come to room temperature so it can be spread over the outside of the turkey. Put the slices under the skin. Put peeled onions halves and garlic cloves in the cavity of the turkey. Pour the neck juices in the roasting pan (or place the uncooked neck in the roasting pan along with 2 cups water if you are using a roasting rack). </p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place the probes in the turkey and set it in the oven. You may need help because of the probe wires to the unit on the sink. Roast the turkey 30 minutes, cover loosely with foil, turn the temperature down to 350 degrees. Cooking time is approximately 17 minutes per pound. As soon as the timer on the unit alerts you that the internal temperature has reached 165 degrees, remove the turkey from the oven, keep it loosely covered, and let it rest for an hour.</p>\n<h3>Gravy</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>3 &#8211; 4 cups juices from turkey (if the juices condense while the turkey is cooking, reconstitute with water)</li>\n<li>1/4 cup flour</li>\n<li>1 cup water</li>\n<li>salt</li>\n<li>pepper</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>While the turkey is resting you will be removing juices for the gravy with a turkey baster. It&#8217;s helpful to have a<br />\n<a title=\"fat separator\" href=\"https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/oxo-good-grips-reg-fat-separator/5162309?skuId=13355266&#038;&#038;mrkgcl=609&#038;mrkgadid=3253336595&#038;enginename=google&#038;mcid=PS_googlepla_nonbrand_kitchenfoodprep_local&#038;product_id=13355266&#038;adtype=pla&#038;product_channel=local&#038;adpos=1o4&#038;creative=356249224553&#038;device=c&#038;matchtype=&#038;network=g&#038;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvtztrbux5gIVh4bACh0H2Av7EAQYBCABEgLqTfD_BwE&#038;gclsrc=aw.ds\">fat separator</a> to put the juices into to remove the fat. If not, put them in a large jar and when the fat has risen to the to the top use the turkey baster to remove the juices at the bottom and transfer them to a small sauce pan. Heat the juices. While they are heating shake the flour and water in a jar. When the juices are boiling whisk in some of the flour/water mixture adding more until you get the thickness you want. At this point the gravy may already be very flavorful and not need any salt. Taste for salt first before you add any. Sprinkle in a little pepper. </p>\n<h3>Carving the Turkey</h3>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Remove the legs and wings at the joints and separate the drumsticks from the thighs at the joints. Make a cut along the side of the breastbone on either side and remove the entire breasts and slice them into 1/2&#8243; slices.</p>\n<h3>Garnish Ideas for the Turkey Platter</h3>\n<p>If you want to garnish the turkey, have what you&#8217;ve chosen washed and ready in a large baggie the day before.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fresh herbs like parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</li>\n<li>dried or fresh bay leaves</li>\n<li>small fruit like grapes, kumquats, mini lady apples, mini pears, and clementines</li>\n<li>citrus like lemons and oranges, cut in slices or wedges</li>\n<li>fresh

      "rendered": "<p>Before you make mashed potatoes, it&#8217;s good to understand why certain potatoes work better for mashed potatoes, which is why mashed potato recipes list the kinds of potatoes to use (usually russet and Yukon Gold). Waxy potatoes, like red potatoes and white potatoes, hold their shape making them perfect for scalloped potato recipes. But waxy potatoes are not good for mashed potatoes. Because of their low starch content they will have a gluey or gummy texture when they are mashed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For a cook, why does a potato’s starch content matter?<br />\nHigh-starch potatoes, such as russets (baking potatoes), have densely packed starch cells that swell and separate from one another when cooked, resulting in a dry, fluffy texture. High-starch potatoes also make creamy mashed potatoes and french fries with a flaky interior. On the other hand, low-starch potatoes, such as round red- or white-skinned potatoes, have moister, loosely packed starch cells that don’t separate from one another, so these potatoes retain their shape better, even when boiled. That’s why they work so well in salads and stews. New potatoes, or creamers, are also low-starch and slightly sweeter than other low-starch potatoes because they are harvested young, before all of their sugars have converted into starch. Finally, medium-starch potatoes, such as Yukon Golds and Yellow Finns, occupy the middle ground. They’re known as all-purpose potatoes because they have a moderate starch content, which makes them suitable for any cooking technique.&#8221;<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.finecooking.com/article/the-science-of-cooking-potatoes-2\">Fine Cooking</a>, &#8220;The Science of Cooking Potatoes&#8221; </p>\n<p>Mashed potatoes will absorb more of the cream and butter watery if they aren&#8217;t over cooked which makes them watery, and if you drain them well and then return them back to the pot to remove all the water. Other than using the right kind of potato and these tips, all the other options listed in many recipes work great. You can leave the skins on if you like. You can use whole milk, cream, or half and half, less or more butter, and more or less salt and pepper. </p>\n<p>For a turkey dinner, I prefer a basic mashed potatoes with the gravy. But if you want to jazz it up a bit you can add a little parmesan cheese or grated white cheddar, and you will often see cream cheese and sour cream used in place of some of the milk, as well as chopped chives, green onions or a sprinkle of paprika on the top. </p>\n<p>This dish can be made the day before, refrigerated and reheated gently. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1659sm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16524\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1659sm.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1659sm-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Grandma&#8217;s Mashed Potatoes</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>4 pounds (about 6 5&#8243; to 6&#8243;) russet potatoes, peeled and cut down the middle and then cut in 1&#8243; slices</li>\n<li>1 1/2 cup milk, cream or half and half</li>\n<li>1 peeled large garlic clove (opt)</li>\n<li>3/4 cup butter, divided </li>\n<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Cut the butter in pieces (reserve 2 tablespoons of butter) and place them in the mixing bowl to come to room temperature. Fill a large pot 3/4 full of water, adding a few shakes of salt. Place potatoes cold water, turn on heat and bring to a boil, and boil about 15 minutes until tender but still firm. Heat the milk/cream with the peeled garlic clove in a small sauce pan. Pour the potatoes into a colander and shake out all the water, then return them back to the empty pot over the heat, tossing the potatoes for 30 seconds to a minute to allow all the moisture to evaporate.</p>\n<p>Discard the garlic from the cream. Run the potatoes through a potato ricer into the mixing bowl with the butter, then incorporate the warm cream, and salt and pepper, into the riced potatoes and butter using a large spoon or blend the mixture on low speed, blending only briefly so they stay fluffy and don&#8217;t start to get gluey. Taste for salt and pepper. </p>\n<p>You can cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and place it in a pot of hot water to keep them warm (&#8220;bain-marie&#8221;) or transfer the potatoes to a casserole with a lid and place on a warming tray. Put the reserved 2 tablespoons of butter in the center of the potatoes, and sprinkle lightly with pepper before covering.</p>\n<p>For a cheese mashed potatoes, add 1 cup of grated gourmet white cheddar cheese. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1632.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16526\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1632.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1632-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1648.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16525\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1648.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1648-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8231.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17066\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8231.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8231-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n",

It was recipe my Mom adapted from a cookbook in her culinary library written by Dorothy Bridges, Lloyd Bridges&#8217; wife, and mother of Beau and Jeff Bridges.</p>\n<p>There are a number of recipes like this on the internet and you&#8217;ll notice different ratios of cream cheese and sour cream verses the amount of potatoes. This determines the level of desired tanginess, like when you add sour cream to a baked potato. Mrs. Bridges&#8217; recipe calls for 1 pound of potatoes. My mom did the recipe using 2 pounds. Also, the original recipe had a few more steps, adding the butter to the hot potatoes, then whipping the cream cheese and sour cream in a blender before folding them in. To simplify the recipe my mom added the butter, cream cheese, sour cream, salt and pepper to the hot potatoes in the pot, and whipped them all together with a hand mixer. I&#8217;ve included another simple way of doing the recipe where you still follow the original recipe of whipping the cream cheese and sour cream.  </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1861sm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16739\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1861sm.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1861sm-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h2>Dorothy Bridges&#8217; Party Potatoes</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>2 pounds (6 5&#8243;) russet potatoes (1 tablespoon of salt for the cooking water)</li>\n<li>1/3 cup butter</li>\n<li>1 8 ounce package cream cheese, softened</li>\n<li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>\n<li>paprika</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Set out the butter, cream cheese and sour cream to soften. Peel potatoes and quarter lengthwise; cut crosswise 1/2 inch thick and put into a pot of enough cold water to cover them by 1 inch. Add 1 tablespoon salt.   Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cook until potatoes are just tender (not falling apart too much), about 20 minutes.   Pour potatoes and water through a colander, then return potatoes to the pot. Stir over medium-high heat about 30 seconds until dry. Remove from heat. </p>\n<p>Method 1 (hand mixer): Add the cream cheese mixture and salt and pepper to the pot and use a hand mixer to blend them.</p>\n<p>Method 2 (free standing mixer): Put the butter, cream cheese and sour cream in the mixing bowl and beat until smooth and fluffy. Add the potatoes (rice them if you want to get rid of any lumps) along with salt and pepper and whip them until blended. </p>\n<p>Spoon the potatoes into buttered casserole. Sprinkle lightly with paprika. Bake in a 325 degree oven for 30 minutes.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1821-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16733\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1821-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1821-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1830.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16711\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1830.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1830-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_5989.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17062\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_5989.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_5989-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_5369.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17064\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_5369.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_5369-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8964-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17082\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8964-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8964-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8964.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Not too long ago, as I was researching the subject and asking a lot of questions, I learned the sameness and difference between &#8216;stuffing&#8217; and &#8216;dressing.&#8217; They are the same thing in terms of ingredients but &#8216;stuffing&#8217; is when you put it in the cavity of the turkey and &#8216;dressing&#8217; is baked in a casserole. So technically this is a dressing recipe but most people use the name stuffing to refer to both ways of cooking it.</p>\n<p>When it became more popular to cook the stuffing in a casserole, I tried it and found that it&#8217;s less fuss and mess doing it this way and most importantly I have more control over how moist (dry vs. soggy) the stuffing comes out. If you miss the turkey flavor, instead of the chicken broth, add the juices from the turkey pan when you remove it from the oven to tent and rest.  </p>\n<p>A long time friend of mine (Thank you, Linda!) put me on to the recipe on the back of the Arrowhead Mills Stuffing package. I used salted butter and added a little more of it. I have also listed some options. I ordered the jarred tree chestnuts online. It was a French brand and they were much better than some packaged chestnuts I bought here. You can use fresh chestnuts that you have roasted or I tried canned water chestnuts and they were fine too.</p>\n<p>You can make this stuffing add pieces of roasted chicken or turkey for a dinner casserole. Steamed broccoli would be a nice accompaniment.</p>\n<p>This dish can be put together the day before and cooked the day of.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1752sm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16615\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1752sm.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1752sm-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Chestnut and Mushroom Stuffing</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>3 celery stalks, cut in small pieces (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>\n<li>1 medium onion, cut in small pieces (about 2 cups)</li>\n<li> 1 1/2 cups chopped crimini mushrooms</li>\n<li>1/2 cup butter plus 2 tablespoons, divided</li>\n<li>10 ounces sausage* (optional)</li>\n<li>Trader Joes Cornbread Stuffing, Whole Foods 365 Stuffing, or Arrowhead Mills Organic Stuffing Savory Herb</li>\n<li>1/3 cup chopped flat leaf parsley</li>\n<li>1 cup peeled and coarsely chopped jarred chestnuts or fresh chestnuts that you have roasted and peeled, or a can of water chestnuts, chopped</li>\n<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh sage (packed)</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>\n<li>2 cups chicken stock</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Use one tablespoon of butter to butter a piece of foil, that will be used as a cover while baking, and an 11&#8243; by 7&#8243; (2  1/2 quart) casserole. </p>\n<p>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet. Add the celery, onions and mushrooms. Cover and let cook 4 minutes. Remove lid and add sausage. Sauté until sausage is cooked. (If you are using the Trader Joes Stuffing, add the seasoning packet at this point.) Add the remaining butter and let it melt. Mix the vegetable mixture with the stuffing mix, parsley, sage, chestnuts, salt and pepper. Spoon into buttered casserole. Poke any large cubes of bread down into the stuffing so when it&#8217;s cooked, they won&#8217;t dry out and become chewy. </p>\n<p>Up to this point can be done the day before and stored in the fridge. Bring the casserole out 30 to 40 minutes before heating to bring to room temperature. Add the chicken broth or turkey juices, cover with the piece of buttered foil and bake in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes. Remove cover and bake 15 minutes. Fluff with a fork before serving.</p>\n<p>*The original recipe calls for Hot Italian Sausage Meat but not everyone likes spicy. My godmother uses Jimmy Dean in her stuffing, a recipe she picked up from her mother-in-law that may date back 130 years. Pork is the most flavorful. I choose Country Breakfast Sausage from the butcher department at Whole Foods. Go with your own personal taste when it comes to sausage. And if you prefer just to taste the bread, vegetables and herbs, this stuffing is also delicious without the sausage.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1726-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16584\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1726-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1726-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1732.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16570\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1732.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1732-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1737.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16571\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1737.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1737-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/16049912518_dbb603f19c_k-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"size-full wp-image-16588\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/16049912518_dbb603f19c_k-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/16049912518_dbb603f19c_k-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<p><a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/goosmurf/16049912518/in/photolist\">Photo of tree chestnuts by Yun Huang Yong</a></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8905-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17055\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8905-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8905-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8905.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8911-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17054\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8911-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8911-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8911.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>An original comfort food from half a century ago that has remained a favorite for generations, broccoli casserole, like the green bean casserole, was made (and many of the recipes online still are) with canned soups like cream of chicken and cream of mushroom, mayonnaise, and American cheese or Velveeta cheese. These casseroles were so popular they became a traditional part of a Thanksgiving meal.</p>\n<p>Since then, we have learned to shop around the edges of the store if we wanted to be healthier. Luckily it was not difficult to convert these cherished casseroles into healthier versions.</p>\n<p>Also like the green bean casserole, there are many different versions of broccoli casserole on the internet. They can be made with milk, half and half or heavy cream or a mixture of these, adjusting the amount of flour to get the right thickness of the sauce. There are also custard versions where the cream is thickened by blended in eggs. You can also use most kinds of cheeses. Cheddar pairs with broccoli very well. I tried a few different kinds of cheese and learned that the cheese you use defines how this casserole is going to taste. It has to be a good tasting cheese that is right for a broccoli casserole. I did my own taste testing with some fo the top recommended cheeses, Tillamook Extra Sharp Cheddar, Cabot&#8217;s Vermont Seriously Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Cabot&#8217;s Vermont Sharp Cheddar Cheese and Whole Food&#8217;s 365 Sharp Cheddar, which was  <a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/best-cheddar-cheese-supermarket-taste-test-article\">Epicurious&#8217; taste testing kitchen&#8217;s top choice</a>. Cabot&#8217;s Vermont Sharp Cheddar Cheese, a white cheddar, was the no contest winner for me.  </p>\n<p>Many recipes online add a little touch of something different. You could try adding a couple teaspoons of mustard or a spice like nutmeg or an herb. Adapting recipes to your particular taste is a lot of fun so do your own thing and enjoy!</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2070-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16884\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2070-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2070-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2070-1.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<p>This dish tastes better made the day before. </p>\n<h3>Broccoli Casserole With Bread Crumb Topping</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2 medium heads of broccoli (about 6 cups when cooked and chopped)</li>\n<li>1 medium leek</li>\n<li>7 tablespoons butter, divided</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons flour</li>\n<li>2 cups half and half</li>\n<li>1 1/3 cups grated cheddar cheese (Cabot&#8217;s Sharp Cheddar Cheese is good)</li>\n<li>2 slices (1 1/3 cup) sour dough or other white bread</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Cut off broccoli florets and peel the stem and cut in half or quarters if they are large. Steam the broccoli for 8-10 minutes or until completely tender but not mushy. Place on a cutting board and chop. Spoon into 2 1/2 quart casserole.</p>\n<p>Slice the leek down the middle and then in thin slivers and slice into small pieces. Melt 4 tablespoons of  butter in a skillet, add the leeks and sauté 5 minutes stirring often (don&#8217;t let brown). Add the salt, pepper and flour and cook 1 minute. Stir in the half and half and cook until the sauce bubbles and thickens stirring often, about 5 minutes. Stir in the cheddar cheese. Set aside.</p>\n<p>Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter in another skillet and add the bread crumbs, stirring until they are coated. Cook stirring often until lightly toasted, about 4 minutes. Set aside.</p>\n<p>Fold the leek and cream mixture into the chopped broccoli. Spoon the bread crumb mixture over the broccoli. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes. Remove from oven, cool and refrigerate overnight.</p>\n<p>Cover with a lid or foil and reheat in a 350 oven for 20 minutes or until hot.<br />\n*Grate stems for salads.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2073-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16910\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2073-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2073-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2073.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2040-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16913\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2040-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2040-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2040-1.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2044-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16914\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2044-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2044-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_2044-1.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><a href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/?attachment_id=17050\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-17050\"><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8073.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17050\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8073.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8073-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8962-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17075\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8962-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8962-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8962.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_8939-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17031\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_8939-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_8939-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_8939.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n</figure>\n",

When it has melted add the onions and cook until starting to brown, about 2 minutes, then add the garlic, flour, green beans, thyme, bay leaf, whipping cream and chicken stock. Stir, cover and cook 4 minutes. Remove lid, stir in mushrooms and let cook another 3 to 4 minutes uncovered. Green beans should be tender. Taste for seasoning. Transfer into serving dish or casserole and sprinkle with the shallots.</p>\n<p>Bake uncovered at 350 degrees until shallots are hot. May be made and reheated the next day.

If you want banana bread to come out right, the bananas have to be overly ripe or the bread doesn&#8217;t have the flavor it should. Pears need to be at the peak of ripe or when you cook them the divine flavor of roasted pears isn&#8217;t there. Wait for them to be slightly soft when you squeeze them but don&#8217;t wait too long or they will become mushy and difficult to work with. Not too hard and not too soft.

Set over high heat and bring to a boil and lower heat but keep it boiling until the potatoes are tender and you can easily slide a fork into them. Let cool. They can be refrigerated at this point until you are ready to continue with the recipe.)</p>\n<p>Cut the pears in half, remove the core and peel them. Set them in a glass casserole, brush them all over with 1 tablespoon melted butter and turn them core side down. Roast them in a 400 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes (depending on their size) or until they are golden around the edges when you turn them over. Mash them really well with a fork or puree them in a small food processor or NutriBullet. Put the mashed pears, maple syrup, lemon juice, 1/4 cup butter and salt in a sauce pan. Heat to a boil and boil down to 1 1/2 cups, about 20 to 30 minutes. </p>\n<p>Peel and cut the potatoes in 1/3&#8243; slices and arrange half of them in a large (standard 2 quart) soufflé dish. Pour half the sauce over the potatoes. Repeat.  </p>\n<p>Bake in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1757.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16625\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1757.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1757-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3023-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17022\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3023-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_3023-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pears.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17024\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pears.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pears-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8946-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17025\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8946-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8946-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_8946.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n",

The result of the marriage was fabulous! It might even be the best way to showcase fresh corn.</p>\n<p>Make this recipe! And if you are a corn lover, you won&#8217;t be disappointed!</p>\n<p>This dish can be made the day before, refrigerated and reheated gently.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1675sm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16543\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1675sm.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1675sm-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Old Virginia Spoon Bread</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>5 cups whole milk, scalded*</li>\n<li>1 cup cornmeal</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons butter</li>\n<li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon honey</li>\n<li>3 eggs, separated</li>\n<li>3 ears of corn (about 1 1/3 cups)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Beat the eggs whites until stiff and set aside. Whisk in the cornmeal into the scalded milk and cook, whisking constantly, for 5 minutes. Whisk in the yolks, then the butter, salt and honey. Fold in the egg whites and corn and pour into a deep 2 1/2 quart casserole. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes. When it comes out of the oven, it is very hot. Let sit for 10-15 minutes before serving. It will have puffed up very high in the oven like a soufflé, then will settle down and thicken. </p>\n<p>*Scald milk by heating just to the point where it starts to rise up the pot. Use a tall pan so if you aren&#8217;t watching it, it won&#8217;t boil over the rim and make a mess. Also, if you can feel a film stuck on the bottom of the pan as you begin to use the whisk, pour the milk into a bowl, remove the film from the pan and put the milk back in before continuing the recipe so there&#8217;s no risk of burnt pieces getting into the bread. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1666.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16532\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1666.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1666-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1672-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16540\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1672-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1672-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6274.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17012\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6274.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6274-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6606.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-17004\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6606.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_6606-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_8969-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17096\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_8969-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_8969-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_8969.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n",

I made several changes to the original recipe, i.e. white balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice because it&#8217;s my favorite for sweet salad dressings. I used both green and red cabbage and a little radicchio for color. And the original recipe called for 1/2 teaspoon cumin and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne which I tried but I didn&#8217;t care for so decided to do something different. I changed the cumin and cayenne  to 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and was much happier. I also tried a 1/2 teaspoon of Garum Masala instead of the cinnamon and thought it was also blended well with the other flavors.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1814-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16848\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1814-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1814-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_1814.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h2>Cabbage and Carrot Salad With Cranberries, Mint and Almonds</h2>\n<h3>Salad</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<p>Use any amount of each of the salad ingredients.

So this isn&#8217;t some passing fad&#8230;&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Most of the experts we interviewed would agree, the future of medicine has the microbiome playing a central role.&#8221;<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.well.org\">Pedram Shoji, OMD</a>, author and Host of &#8220;Interconnected: The Power to Heal From Within&#8221;</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re in a new paradigm of medicine. &#8220;This is a movement that will grow because it&#8217;s truth.&#8221;<br />\nJoel Evans, MD, &#8220;Interconnected: The Power to Heal From Within&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We really are in the area of research where the microbiome is really hitting all fields so microbiome health is impacting cardiology, neurology, immunology, endocrinology, that they&#8217;re finding your gut microbiome can impact all these different disease processes. Now they&#8217;re still trying to figure out how but they do know that the more diverse your gut is that the more protective effects you have through all these different diseases.&#8221;<br />\n<a href=\"https://drknews.com/about-dr-datis-kharrazian/\">Datis Kharrazian</a>, PhD, DHSc, DC, MS, MMSc, FACN, is a clinical research scientist, academic professor, author and a functional medicine health care provider.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The bacteria in the microbiome help digest our food, regulate our immune system, protect against other bacteria that cause disease and produce vitamins including B and Vitamins B12, thiamine and riboflavin and Vitamin K, which is needed for blood coagulation.&#8221; A break down anywhere in the good bacteria&#8217;s role, can lead to sugar and hormone imbalances and deregulation of neurotransmitters which can affect mood, sleep, hunger, energy, etc., malfunctions of the body&#8217;s systems, as well as malfunctions and diseases of glands and organs. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Autoimmune deseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, and fibromyalgia are associated with dysfunction in the microbiome. Disease-causing microbes accumulate over time, changing gene activity and metabolic processes and resulting in an abnormal immune response against substances and tissues normally present in the body. Autoimmune diseases appear to be passed in families not by DNA inheritance but by inheriting the family&#8217;s microbiome.&#8221;<br />\n<a href=\"https://depts.washington.edu/ceeh/downloads/FF_Microbiome.pdf\">Center for Ecogenics and Environmental Health, &#8220;Fast Facts About the Human Microbiome&#8221; </a></p>\n<p>“Now that we understand what the normal human microbiome looks like, we should be able to understand how changes in the microbiome are associated with, or even cause, illnesses.”<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/healthy-human-microbiome\">Human Microbiome Project, National Institutes of Health</a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Metagenomics is the DNA study of the various microbes within the gut itself. It&#8217;s the same thing they use to try and study and figure out the human genome.&#8221; &#8220;When we did the Human Genome Project we were trying to figure out exactly what kind of gene controlled all the different disease markers.&#8221; &#8220;The idea was for every disease there was a gene that controlled it. If we could find that gene, we could somehow manipulate it and somehow change the outcome of the disease.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have 22,000 functional genes. Our microbiome has 3.3 million genes.&#8221; &#8220;The microbial genes, the genes that come from the bacteria that live in our body account for 99% of our metabolic function.&#8221; &#8220;Everything that is happening in your body right now, 1% was coded for the genes you have in your cells. 99% of it was coded for the bacteria that live in your body. That&#8217;s how much control they have over us.&#8221; &#8220;So it becomes exceedingly important to understand who they are, what they are doing and how we can influence them.&#8221; The human genome project was about linking our DNA to diseases and seeing how it could be manipulated to avoid the disease. Now the race is on to connect the DNA of our microbes to which disease and then build up those microbes.<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vimIavvN2cs&#038;t=272s\">Dr. Kiran Krishnan, microbiologist and Co-founder of Microbiome Labs</a> </p>\n<p>&#8216;The microbiome is cohabiting our body with us. In the past most immunity research focused on the white blood cells and antibodies and while these are important, we need to rethink what it means to be human. The understanding of the microbiome is going to overturn everything we think we know about health, about nutrition and medicine. The previous thousands of scientific papers are invalidated because the microbiome was invisible to them. We have far more cells that are fungal and bacterial than human. We humans need to go from feeding one to feeding trillions to boost our immune systems and overall health.&#8217;<br />\n&#8220;Remedy: Ancient Medicine for Modern Illness&#8221; </p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8216;Name just about any ailment plaguing us and you’ll find some ­researchers discovering the microbial angle for a connection,&#8217; says {Scientist Jeff} Leach {of <a href=\"http://humanfoodproject.com/about-the-human-food-project/\">The Human Food Project</a>}, whose latest book, <em>Bloom: Reconnecting with Your Primal Gut in a Modern World</em>, is due out this fall {Sept. 2013}.

It&#8217;s also basic knowledge that fiber is good for you. Most people know fiber keeps your body regular. But few people are aware of the much more significant role fiber plays in the body. Fiber is food, a &#8216;prebiotic,&#8217; for the microbes in our gut. And it&#8217;s not just after antibiotics that we need to be replenishing the good bacteria and feeding them a lot of fiber. We&#8217;ve arrived at a place where we&#8217;ve become aware that our diet and environment have done our microbiomes, more responsible for our health than we ever imagined, great harm, leading to all the new diseases. The good news is, scientists and doctors are figuring it out and working hard to fix the problems.  </p>\n<p>Whether you are feeling it yet or not, people eating a normal diet are aging and on the path to imbalance of the microbes, resulting in a dysfunction of the body eventually leading to disease. Everyone, children included, all are in need of repairing, rebalancing and strengthening the microbial powerhouse that is playing a huge role in your health and happiness. Our toxic environment and stressful lives need to be addressed. But the biggest help we can give our microbiome is done primarily through diet. What you eat is what the microbes are eating. And the kinds of foods you eat can be building up the good microbes and starving the bad microbes or the reverse, or somewhere in between.</p>\n<p>Normally the microbiome is able to police the microbes and keep itself balanced. But the changes in recent decades to our diet, medicine and lifestyle, along with the modern day environmental toxins, turned out to be beyond the microbiome&#8217;s ability to care for itself and us. This battle going on that was unknown to us resulted in more disease and the new autoimmune diseases and an epidemic of obesity, more every year and at younger ages. The number of diseases are exploding like nothing doctors have ever seen before in all of history. Our genes haven&#8217;t changed. But our environment, which includes our food, has changed. Research into this health crisis lead to the discovery of the microbiome, and as more doctors became aware of the research a new kind of medical field emerged called &#8216;functional medicine&#8217; which has caught the attention of both conventional medical doctors and holistic doctors.</p>\n<p>What was found was that stress, our greasy, mostly processed food diet, overuse of antibiotics, polluted water and air, and our over sterilized and sanitized lifestyle, to name a few things, have ravaged the microbiome and left it with not enough of the different good microbes and an overgrowth of problematic microbes. This state of &#8216;dysbiosis&#8217; means a weakened microbiome that has lost its ability to control the right balance of microbes and it&#8217;s now malfunctioning. The first line of immune defense is down allowing invaders – undigested food particles, toxins and bugs – into our body through inflamed, &#8220;leaky&#8221; intestine walls to wreak havoc all the way up to our brains. There are many books and articles now showing how the application of the new protocols to address the microbiome imbalances is already reversing very complex health crises many people have found themselves in. </p>\n<p>Both the microbiome and the body will self-repair if properly supported. Mindfully replenishing the diminished microbes by feeding them prebiotic foods, botanicals, taking probiotics, body chemistry,  and the nutrients that the microbe isn&#8217;t making enough of until it can again, fasting, exercising, and, while the gut is healing, avoiding what you know to be inflammatory foods for you — all these will support the weakened and overwhelmed microbiome as it rebuilds and rebalances enabling the microbes to once again police the bad microbe issues, keep out of the body what doesn&#8217;t belong, and fix malfunctions in the gut that lead to malfunctions in the rest of the body. </p>\n<p>Making the change to your diet to feed the microbiome begins with a better understanding of plant fiber and soil. After fiber-rich foods are digested, the fiber will have passed through the stomach and small intestine not fully digested and absorbed. It then moves into the large intestine, headquarters for all the microbial activity going on all over our body, and where most of the microbiota are. Here the fiber becomes a prebiotic. It ferments and feeds this micro life, building up the normal bacteria that is powering the first line of defense of your immune system which is in your gut, as well as your body, and all the chemical reactions, and metabolic cycles and processes taking place in your gut and in your body supplying what is needed everywhere. In addition to being food for microbes, the breaking down and fermenting of fiber releases short-chained fatty acids needed in the mitochondrial metabolic process of creating energy. Mitochondria are the energy producing organelles in the cells of our body. Without this energy, that all the organelles of cells require to do their jobs, there is cell dysfunction and cell death which leads to a malfunction in the body.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_0839-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15745\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_0839-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_0839-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<p>(Pictured: tatsoi, gold ball turnip, radicchio, green daikon radish, grated purple stoke sweet potato, kale, watermelon radish, and fennel fronds) </p>\n<p>The building up of the different kinds of microbes begins in the womb and then there&#8217;s a huge influx the day you are born. As you leave the womb, you pick up a large part of the bacteria you need from your mother&#8217;s body. Then right away you begin to be exposed to toxins, pathogens, viruses, fungi, yeast, opportunistic bacteria, potential auto-immune triggers, and in many cases parasites get picked up somewhere. The exposure to bacteria programs your immune system. It learns, and matures and develops through the exposure process and remains strong the same way. As a child grows up the microbiome builds up what needs to deal with the environment and deal with all these different things that come into the gut and make their home in the microbiome, many with the potential to cause problems if they get overgrown. It learned to police these microbes, and keep low in number what we thought were bad microbes but that turned out to play a positive role in the microbiome. So sanitizing everything turned out to be the wrong thing to do. </p>\n<p>In his book <em>Gut Balance Revolution</em> Dr. Gerald Mullin states, &#8220;Research has shown that children raised in rural environment, where playing in the dirt and being around farm animals are more common. Have lower incidences of allergies and other autoimmune conditions.&#8221; In quoting from Dr. Daphne Miller&#8217;s book <em>Farmacology</em> he says, &#8220;One of the recurring theses in the book is that the microbial biodiversity of the soil breeds the diversity of our gut microbiome and impacts our health in a variety of ways.&#8221; He also mentions that the exposure to other children is exposure to more microbes. Today there is a rise in childhood health issues — weight gain, diabetes, cancer. </p>\n<p>You may not have been living close to the dirt where the good bacteria are, and where your microbiome is built up faster as dirt blew into your nose and hitched a ride on your hands into your mouth giving you a good start in life, but we can have that benefit from dirt now without having to live with dirt. Teams of researchers, microbiologists and biochemists have been making probiotics using the most beneficial probiotic strains in soil. They found that spore-forming microbes will survive the trip to through the digestive system to the colon where they will colonize. &#8216;Soil-based&#8217; probiotics are a mixture of spore-forming and normal. &#8216;Spore-based&#8217; probiotics, like <a href=\"https://microbiomelabs.com/products/megasporebiotic/\">MegaSporeBiotic</a>, developed by Microbiome Labs, founded by microbiology researcher Dr. Kiran Krishnan and Dr. Tom Bayne, a functional medicine doctor, are all spores. The spores in MegaSporeBiotic do more than &#8216;reseed&#8217; with good microbes, they &#8220;recondition&#8221; the microbiome. Dr. Krishnan explains this in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgYzhVnnLyM&#038;t=2701s\">&#8220;How to Improve Gut Health and the Microbiome&#8221;</a>, an interview with author Leah Segetie. These spore microbes recondition by coming into the gut and accessing the condition of the microbiota, and, among a number of things they do, they will stand next to bad or overgrown microbes and make antibodies to lower the population of these microbes, or stand near good ones that are too low and make prebiotics for them to raise their numbers. They will also remove microbes that are in the wrong place in the gut. Using these spores to treat digestive disorders is not new. Doctor&#8217;s in many countries have been using it since the 50&#8217;s. Microbiome Labs is doing many studies and trials and perfecting its use.</p>\n<p>We are intimately connected to earth. Simply put, from photosynthesis with the power of the sun, plants turn photons into sugar or carbohydrates for the microbes in the soil around the plants&#8217; roots. Then the microbes give the plants what they need to grow and be healthy. Then we feed the plants to our microbiome which supplies the various microbes what they need to be healthy and function properly. Then the microbiota digest the food and send into our body what it needs to function and be healthy. </p>\n<p>Being outdoors in the dirt and around animals is more than getting more different kinds of microbes for a more diverse microbiome, it&#8217;s also coming in contact with &#8216;bad&#8217; microbes, even deadly ones, that play a role in strengthening the immune system. The way our defenses build up so our immune system can handle a strong exposure to an invader is by making anti-bodies, an army of them, as a result of having been exposed to an array of small amounts of harmful microbes in the environment. One group of doctors and researchers are addressing the problem of missing out on good microbes in dirt and another group of medical professionals and researchers, herbalists, have know for 1000&#8217;s of years that, among other things that grow in nature, eating mushrooms (fungi), like reishe and chaga, fortify the immune system enabling it to keep bad microbes in check so they don&#8217;t cause an illness or other inflammatory response. There are around 6000 recorded botanicals for human health. These plants and/or fungi are can be taken for two different health goals. You can take some to address an illness, or particular health condition or symptom. And the much broader use for them, and what they have been used for historically for thousands of years, is to prevent illness and aging. You can make these powerful botanicals part of your microbiome-centered diet, increasing the variety and potency of the foods you are eating on a regular basis, resulting in a stronger microbiome and staying healthy and living longer. If you want to have a very good understanding of these botanicals, I recommend the excellent 9 part series, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U0zVFIUL4c\">&#8220;Remedy: Ancient Medicine for Modern Illness&#8221;</a>. Plants of all kinds, growing in different places all over the world, are vital for us to heal and maintain healthy microbiomes and bodies. There is a medicinal component, limited but there, in all the vegetables and greens we eat. And there are other much more powerful plants, very special plants, that, when you have a serious debilitating health condition, can play a key role in helping you get your life back and keeping it that way.</p>\n<p>Dr. Garland Glenn, a functional medicine doctor and owner of <a href=\"https://drgarlandglenn.com\">The Carroll Institute</a>, quoting another doctor said to me, &#8216;After antibiotics, take probiotics but also go to the grocery store and buy every kind of organic foods you see, including the ones where you don&#8217;t know what they are, and go home and make a smoothie out of them using a machine that doesn&#8217;t remove the fiber, and drink this twice a day,&#8217; and he added &#8216;especially roots {and tubers}.&#8217; A Nutrabullet works great for the smoothies. You can do a smoothie for breakfast and I decided to have the second batch of raw vegetables as a large salad. Make both out of of all different kinds of plants and vegetables that are new to you, and use vegetables raw that you&#8217;d previously only eaten cooked. A selection of blended vegetables can end up undrinkable but those same vegetables are fine for a salad. I have made some suggestions below under the picture of a smoothie. (Please make a note of the <em>list of foods</em> at the end of this post <em>that should not be eaten raw</em>). </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1485.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16246\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1485.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1485-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;But rather than chewing a carrot, better to spread it and put it in your salad because you&#8217;re massively increasing the surface area and your ability to absorb the nutrients and fiber.&#8221; Dr. Mercola</p>\n<p>(Pictured: sliced green beens, grated purple top turnip, grated jicama, grated green kohlrabi, grated black radish, and grated orange carrots on sliced komatsuna greens or &#8216;Japanese mustard spinach&#8217; with stems and sliced Japanese Hakurei turnip greens and stems, and mint)</p>\n<p>Hunter-gatherer peoples, hunting animals and gathering nuts, berries and tubers, are doing two things well. They are exposed to more probiotic spores from dirt coming in, and then they build those up with their very diversified, high fiber diet, which is also feeding the normal, non-spore, microbes in their gut. And, I should add that they aren&#8217;t eating soaked or triple washed vegetables where there is only a small possibility that any microbes remain on the outer skin. Dr. Weil&#8217;s article, <a href=\"https://www.drweil.com/diet-nutrition/nutrition/diet-for-a-better-microbiome/\">&#8220;Diet for a Better Microbiome&#8221;</a>, reports some studies done on hunter-gatherer peoples in the world where something interesting has been learned about the microbiome. These people eat a lot more fiber and 600 different kinds of foods, meals made of small amounts of a lot of things, compared to Americans&#8217; (typical) 15 different kinds, meals with large portions of  a few foods. These ancient people were also tested and were found to have less diversity during certain seasons, and then the return of the diversity in other seasons. There was a follow up study done on mice where it was taken away and then returned with the same results.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s speculated that we have a huge variety of microbes and it&#8217;s when we eat the food they need that they grow in number and are able to play their role in protecting and strengthening us. Dr. Mick Hall, a biorestorologist and owner of <a href=\"http://www.35forlife.com\"> 35 for Life</a>, expressed his opinion this way. He believes &#8220;we all have a near unlimited number of species of organisms within the intestinal tract, but according to gut health, most are suppressed until properly supported to reproduce.&#8221; And another doctor put it this way, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t eat the preferred fuel of the species of microbe, that microbe will decrease until it&#8217;s fed again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>You can be &#8220;rich&#8221; in microbes, meaning a lot of different kinds of microbes, but if they are low in number, the diversity is not there. They need to be rich and there needs to be &#8220;uniformity&#8221; in order for there to be diversity. In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7IPbbzZaGY\">interview with Dr. Joline Brighten</a>, microbiologist researcher Dr. Krishnan explained that &#8220;The microbes have different capabilities of their own, meaning they each produce different kinds of enzymes.&#8221; &#8220;So they specialize in breaking down different types of carbon molecules&#8230;simplistic carbohydrate structures or complex carbohydrate structures.&#8221; &#8220;They need a variety of carbon sources.&#8221; &#8220;And it&#8217;s counterintuitive but other microbes do well when you are fasting on a regular basis.&#8221; </p>\n<p>When you aren&#8217;t feeding your microbiome for &#8220;14 to 16 hours&#8221; the numbers of microbes that only do well when you are fasting will increase helping you create both the richness and uniformity and because it&#8217;s not having to digest food all the time, it has time to take out the trash and do repairs. Polyphenols, found in foods like dark chocolate, blueberries and flaxseed meal, aid in the rebuilding of the mucosal layer of the intestinal wall. Dr. Krishnan discusses what to avoid, including explaining what stress does, and lists all the good things to be doing for the microbiome, along with the building up of microbes and the rebuilding of the gut lining that happens during intermittent fasting in the interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgYzhVnnLyM&#038;t=2885s\">with Leah Segedie</a>. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2261-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17171\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2261-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2261-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2261.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<p>(Pictured: grated red radishes, purple daikon, watermelon radish, routabaga, purple stoke yam, yellow and orange carrots on a bed of micro greens, kale, savoy cabbage, red cabbage, radish greens and celery root greens.)</p>\n<p>Green bananas and cold (not reheated) cooked white potatoes and cold (not reheated) cooked white rice are examples of another microbe loving carbon food. &#8220;Resistant starch is not exactly a fiber, but another form of carbohydrate [long form of glucose molecules really] that functions like soluble and fermentable fiber. Like fiber, resistant starch is not fully broken down and absorbed in your small intestine and gut bacteria thrive on it. When fermented, resistant starch produces short-chain fatty acids as well as gases [which in turn can lead to bloating and abdominal discomfort when eaten/taken in excess].&#8221;<br />\n<a href=\"https://inbodyusa.com/blogs/inbodyblog/all-about-fiber-and-its-dirty-little-secrets/\">InBodyusa.com</a></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2404-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17249\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2404-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2404-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2404.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2420lg-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17250\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2420lg-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2420lg-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_2420lg.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<p>(Pictured: cold potato salad made with 5 &#8211; 6 cups cubed cooked potatoes (you can use peeled russets or unpeeled Yukon or red potatoes which are waxy potatoes that will hold their shape better than russets), 2 tablespoons each thinly sliced basil, dill, parsley, 1 tablespoon thinly sliced chives, 1 stalk of celery, chopped, 3 tablespoons chopped shallots, 1/2 cup olive oil or part mayonnaise, 1/2 teaspoon each marjoram and salt, topped with sliced and chopped radishes.)  </p>\n<p>&#8220;A full system reset is a great way to establish your baseline so that you can begin to identify your own optimum dietary habits.&#8221;<br />\n<a href=\"https://kellybroganmd.com/resistant-starch-why-your-body-needs-it/\">Dr. Kelly Brogan</a></p>\n<p>When you&#8217;ve been on a restricted anti-inflammatory diet you are doing a system reset. For a specified time it&#8217;s very strict and then foods are reintroduced and you watch for sensitivities. If you have become very sensitive, it can take awhile to figure out all the foods that are inflaming your gut and keeping it from being able to heal. The reset is a critical step towards healing the gut. Something happens as a result of the restrictions where you are better able to listen to your gut, a clearer communication that enables you to figure out your diet that will lead to long term healthy changes. And your taste buds change and what you enjoy eating changes and it&#8217;s the communication with the healing microbiome that is involved in this. </p>\n<p>On the restriction, or anti-inflammatory, diets, all grains and sugars (carbs), including sugary fruits like watermelon and grapes, are eliminated. These are high glycemic foods that digest quickly and spike blood sugar giving you a lot of energy but then the blood sugar drops. On these no sugar/glucose diets, a switch takes place where the body and brain are being powered by fat instead of carbs, referred to as a ketogenic diet. A ketogenic diet is a therapeutic diet that should only be done for the amount of time needed to reach a health goal like the system reset. You start off strict but then you need to move to a mild ketogenic diet because the body and brain need insulin. Eating foods with sugar/glucose cause the release of insulin which, among other metabolic roles it plays, is needed to make protein. If you remain on a strict ketonic diet too long, you can begin to lose muscle mass and your body can be in an almost cachectic state where it begins to waste away. To eat right long term, one answer to the body&#8217;s need for sugar/glucose is resistant starches. And even though they digest slower, it&#8217;s still necessary to eat the right amounts to maintain blood sugar balance, the sweet spot, not too much and not too little.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lack of glucose (sugar) is &#8230; a common cause of poor brain function&#8230; Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and high blood sugar (insulin resistance) both deprive the brain of energy and inflame it.&#8221;<br />\nDatis Kharrazian, PhD, DHSc, DC, MS, MMSc, FACN </p>\n<p>&#8220;Consistent consumption of resistant starches attenuate cravings, up regulate satiety signalling, and help you to stop feeling crazy, especially when you are following a ketogenic diet.&#8221;<br />\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@drstephanie/the-1-bad-carb-you-should-eat-on-the-ketogenic-diet-62bf0735d332\">Dr. Stephanie Estima</a></p>\n<p>Resistant starches are resisting or taking longer to be broken down and this helps stabilized blood sugar levels so you aren&#8217;t dealing with feeling energetic and then falling into fatigue, an imbalance of insulin secretion. Resistant starches improve leptin (another hormone) sensitivity so you feel full when you should, help sleep by enhancing non-REM sleep, curb cravings (the feeling like you&#8217;re starving that no amount of fats or proteins or vegetables can alleviate), better mood and cognitive function because they effect the microbiome&#8217;s production of neurotransmitters, and when resistant starches undergo fermentation the microbiota produce butyrate, a short chain fatty acid that has protective effect in colon cancer and improves T cells, cells that play a vital role in our immune system. When you&#8217;re dealing with diabetes and weight issues, there&#8217;s malfunction involving the regulation of both hormones, insulin and leptin.</p>\n<p>A mild ketosis diet is not only good for your insulin and leptin levels, it raises the protein BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) involved cell regeneration and stem cell growth in the brain for diseases like Alzheimer&#8217;s. BDNF changes the levels of a protein called PGC-1Alpha which plays a role in mitochondrial therapy and regeneration. PGC-1Alpha is also intimately involved in obesity and diabetics and other disorders. The metabolic process of burning fat for fuel generates less free radicals and less inflammation both of which underpin all disease. One of the ketones produced on by burning fat is called beta hydroxy butyrate. This ketone isn&#8217;t just energy for the body. It also stimulates changes in our DNA expression (more on this below). More and more it&#8217;s being found how a mild ketonic diet changes our metabolism dramatically for the good. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_1051.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15705\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_1051.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_1051-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<p>(The grated vegetables in these two pictures are scarlet turnip, white and purple daikon radishes, orange jewel sweet potato, red cabbage, yellow carrot.

These changes included exercising and cutting down on carbs from grains and sugars. Among a number of bad things sugar does to the body, it feeds bad microbes and causes some microbes like Candida to get overgrown and become a problem.</p>\n<p>The kind of meat you eat also effects the microbiome dramatically. Eating commercially raised meat and dairy is ingesting low doses of antibiotics and over time they create bugs that are very difficult to get rid of. The animals are caged and in close quarters and it&#8217;s caused more disease to arise so antibiotics have been put in their food. Animals are being fed grains that are not organically grown. What cows, sheep, and chickens eat, we eat and it effects our microbiome&#8217;s immune function. Look for meats and dairy that say no antibiotics, grass fed, pasture raised coming from animals that are raised in healthier conditions.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve learned to eat rainbow colors of fruits and vegetables that are high in phytochemicals which includes antioxidants to reverse environmental toxins&#8217; oxidizing effect on cells that leads to cancer. I was only seeing the phytochemical value of colored vegetables and didn&#8217;t know about the value of light colored vegetables, like turnips or fennel, or the white parts of vegetables like large bok choy, so I didn&#8217;t buy the lighter ones while treating the stems and ribs of vegetables as scrapes and throwing them away. The colorful foods have important phytochemicals but now we have a more comprehensive view of our very sophisticated immune system that is more inclusive of vegetables and the invaluable role they play in our health. A microbiologist in the Interconnected series made the comment that phytochemicals are prebiotics for good bacteria and he believes that further research will show that phytochemicals are more important to the health of the microbiome than they are to us.</p>\n<p>We are living in an ultra toxic environment and we&#8217;re contributing to the damage it does to our bodies with the toxic foods we&#8217;re eating. Wheat crops in particular are treated with a poison that triggers zonulin in the gut which leads to inflammation if the intestinal lining opening the junctures letting the things that don&#8217;t belong in the body into the blood stream. The inflammation of the cells of our intestinal lining are due to the weakening of the  microbiome&#8217;s defense system by too many toxins and the impossibility of being able to handle it, leading to a more serious cascade of inflammation inside our bodies called &#8216;metabolic LPS endotoxemia.&#8217; LPS is in certain bacteria and when they die it is left behind as an endotoxin. When we eat there is more bacteria turnover and the dead bacteria give off LPS endotoxins. A healthy microbiome gets rid of these. But a weakened microbiome means inflamed intestinal walls with its tight junctures separating letting the LPS endotoxins into the bloodstream of the body. From there the molecular inflammatory cascade begins, what Dr. Krishnan says is &#8220;a mini sepsis.&#8221; Sepsis is lethal, so it follows that chronic &#8216;mini sepsis&#8217; is going to have the devastating effects on the body that we are now experiencing. This is also discussed in Dr. Krishnan&#8217;s interviews.</p>\n<p>Undigested proteins also get through the open junctures and this is what can lead to autoimmune diseases where the immune system that has now created an antibody for the food protein mistakenly identifies part of our body, like the thyroid, as that protein invader because the molecular structure of the thyroid is similar.</p>\n<p>Lectins are a common food that people have become sensitive to, leading to inflammation in different parts of the body manifested in all different ways big and small. Lectins were brought to my attention by talk given by Dr. Hall many years ago and then another doctor told me about Dr. Steven Gundry&#8217;s <em>The Plant Paradox</em>. Lectins are a plant&#8217;s way of protecting itself. It&#8217;s its natural defense system against foreign threats to its survival. Lectins are primarily found in the seeds of both organic and nonorganic vegetables and fruits. When you eat the plant and the lectins go into your body, they kill good bacteria and can greatly effect your microbiome. To support microbiome recovery avoid fruits like pomegranates and kiwi and vegetables like cucumbers and tomatoes that contain a lot of seeds. Nightshades are part of this group and the reason why some people are sensitive to them and experience the symptoms of inflammation.</p>\n<p>Other lectin carrying foods to consider avoiding for awhile are beans, peanuts and cashews, and seeds, like pumpkin, sunflower or chia.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_1167.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15798\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_1167.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_1167-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<p>(When planning your meals, you need to eat a lot of vegetables, but think small amounts of a lot of different kinds of things. This salad is made with white daikon radishes, celery, Hakurei turnips, grated watermelon radishes, julienned sweet potato, sliced Brussel sprouts and <a href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2019/04/14/paleo-marinaded-chicken/\">seasoned chicken</a> and cilantro on a bed of arugula, escarole and endive frisee.)</p>\n<p>Similar to a lactose intolerance, some people have difficulty digesting and have a immune response to fructans, a &#8216;polymer&#8217; or grouping of fructose molecules. If you been wondering why you don&#8217;t feel great after eating cooked and/or raw onions, you may be sensitive to the fructans in onions. Fructans occur in agave, wheat, rye, kamut, spelt, barley, grapefruit, nectarine, plums, persimmon, pomegranate, ripe bananas, watermelon, dates, raisins, prunes, dried pineapple, onions, leeks, shallots, garlic, jicama, snow peas, savoy cabbage, chick peas, cabbage, broccoli, pistachios, artichoke, chicory root, globe and Jerusalem artichokes, Brussels sprouts, beets and asparagus. If you are not feeling well after eating any of these, remove them and try again later after you&#8217;ve healed some more.</p>\n<p>In his talks and interviews, Dr. Krishnan not only lists the things we need to be doing, but he speaks in an understandable language, and using diagrams, describes what is happening at a molecular level that is the reason why we need to make the list of changes. You may have already switched from oils like canola and soybean to healthier oils like olive and avocado, and walnuts, avocados, pecans, brazil nuts and pine nuts. Dr. Krishnan explains that bacteria make LPS from the oils we eat. Going further into studying the cascade of inflammation that starts with LPS endotoxins, the toxins in LPS molecules are in their tail and they vary in strength. LPS made from saturated oils produces a more toxic tail. LPS made from the good oils have a less toxic tail. Of the healthier oils, LPS made from coconut oil is the most toxic and omega oils make much less toxic LPS. So when the microbiome is weak, not keeping the barrier strong and not properly disposing of the LPS released as bacteria dies, all oils, especially when heated, including toasted nuts and cooked fatty meats, cause some degree of inflammation of the intestinal lining causing its junctures to open, letting in LPS endotoxins that triggers the &#8220;mini sepsis&#8217; inflammatory cascade inside the body. </p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve always been told to exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle for numerous reasons including keeping our hearts strong. Exercising also plays a role in rebuilding the microbiome and returning it to full function. All of our muscles atrophy as we age and the fluids in them become stagnant. Recently Dr. Hall told me that the lower back muscles are supporting the large intestine or colon where a majority of the microbiome is. A colon that is not being properly supported becomes distorted and has kinks in it where bacteria get caught and biofilms can form. He said that it is impossible to have a balanced microbiome when the colon is in this condition. Rowing exercises strengthens the withering and congested core muscles and it&#8217;s the lower back muscles that need to be strong again. In several interviews, Dr. Krishnan has said that exercising near the end of the fasting time when the human growth hormones are higher aids the building up of muscles. </p>\n<p>Dr. Krishnan also says that during the fasting time, you think clearer. In an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXRgFzHUJRI\">interview</a>, osteopathic physician and alternative medicine advocate Dr. Joseph Mercola and neurologist Dr. David Perlmutter discuss the importance of exercise for brain health. They discuss how aerobic exercise and mild ketonic diets increase the production of BDNF associated with brain cell therapy, or regrowing the grey matter, leading to cognitive improvement, an enlarged memory center, and the alleviation of depression and anxiety. The highlight of their discussion was seeing that at the height of a chronic disease epidemic we learned something and are now empowered to fight or stave off these diseases like never before.<br />\nTwenty percent of the population have the genetic marker for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. The average person is now living to the age of 85 and half of them, 5.4 million people today, have Alzheimer&#8217;s disease whether they had the genetic markers for it or not. Alzheimer&#8217;s is an epidemic, out of control with no effective drug for it. Medicine has been focusing on our genetic predisposition for diseases. Clearly we are past people only getting chronic diseases they have genetic markers for. But with the recent research into the microbiome, and trials using intermittent fasting, exercise and mild ketogenic diets and other lifestyle changes, we know now that these diseases are preventable. No one inherits a disease. A genetic marker in your DNA doesn&#8217;t determine that you will get it. It&#8217;s been found in clinical trials that diet, exercise and and other &#8220;parameters&#8221;, or &#8220;variables&#8221;, determine whether or not the disease manifests in your life. So even if we have the gene markers and are at greater risk for a particular disease, our DNA expression, or the epigenetic expression of those genes, is something we have control over.</p>\n<p>There is a crisis health situation but out of it came powerful knowledge. We can change our destiny. In Dr. Mercola and Perlmutter&#8217;s very informative discussion on the mechanisms taking place in the body, these doctors clearly connect the dots between powering our bodies with fat instead of carbs along with aerobic exercise and the health of the brain as well as the rest of the body.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also been warned about GMO produce. In addition to fiber, antioxidants, phytonutrients and polyphenols, eating plants also sends information into our bodies. It can be very healing information and it can also be damaging information, and this is where eating only organic vegetables comes in. Many non-organic plants have been genetically modified (GMO). So besides avoiding toxins, you want to buy organic produce to stop bad information from coming in and modifying your DNA. There are now numerous scientific papers on the research being done with exosomes which are particles in plants that contain RNA plant code. When we consume plants, the plant&#8217;s RNA has epigenetic effects on the microbiota&#8217;s RNA coding which can positively or negatively effect behavior like bacteria regeneration and the movement of microbes to different locations in the gut to do repairs. Genetically modifying a plant has a disruptive effect on the plant&#8217;s RNA coding. Then when we eat the plant and its exosomes break open and the modified code of RNA is introduced into our microbiome, this negatively modified code recodes our microbes&#8217; RNA which then adversely effects our DNA coding and expression.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, constitute the four major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life.&#8221; Wikipedia </p>\n<p>Stress/anxiety has also been brought to our attention as a causes of health problems. Stress/anxiety involves the release of hormones that cause an inflammatory response of the intestinal barrier opening its junctures. If you are doing everything right but the level of stress, like the level of toxins, is impossible for a healthy microbiome to handle, the microbiome can&#8217;t heal the intestinal lining and itself and stay healed. In the talk Dr. Perlmutter among the other variables involved in preventing disease he lists nurturing gratefulness and love, distancing yourself from negativity, healing relationships, meditation, creative outlets. These things counteract stress, and there are a number of different herbal plants that fortify the endocrine and nervous systems which are involved in stress/anxiety. Taking these will support the healing and maintenance of your gut lining and microbiome. </p>\n<p>Water is healing. It delivers messages and nutrients and removes waste. Dehydration means the body isn&#8217;t able to function right. There is debate over the amount of water we should consume. Some say if we eat a lot of vegetables, our body get all the water it requires. We are all unique in our needs. Listen to your microbiome as to how much to drink and drink only clean water.      </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_0985-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15734\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_0985-2.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_0985-2-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<p>(Pictured: white button mushrooms, cut up golden ball turnip, grated white sweet potato, sliced carrots, watermelon radishes, grated parsnips, bok choi, butter lettuce and napa cabbage)</p>\n<p>In summary, while the gut microbiome isn&#8217;t telling your body to lift your arm, breathe or when to fall asleep, the gut microbiome is often referred to as a &#8220;second brain&#8221;  or &#8220;other brain&#8221; because it&#8217;s running everything behind how those metabolic operations are functioning. What you learn is that your environment and what you put in your mouth directly effect your gut microbiome making these things very important to what you want your life to be.</p>\n<p>According to microbiologists and the new paradigm of medical doctors, really being healthy starts with the gut microbiome. Get rid of the pathogens and other things that don&#8217;t belong, keep the microbes in balance with the right foods, and keep their home un-inflamed by removing the problematic foods from your diet, take needed nutritional support, lower stress, avoid toxins, exercise and the human body has shown that it can self heal. Weight will come more into balance, and improvements will take place physically, intellectually, and you will feel better emotionally.</p>\n<p>The difference with a healing of the gut, and balancing of the microbiome, centered diet and the healthy diets we thought we were on is small amounts of more kinds of foods and more variety of raw vegetables with a focus on roots and tubers, making it probiotic (if they aren&#8217;t soaked or washed too much) and prebiotic. To give you an idea of all the different vegetables out there in the world \u001f— like ambutan, limau, spapote — see <a href=\"https://www.specialtyproduce.com/produce/rambutan/rambutan_6744.php\">specialtyproduce.com&#8217;s</a>  website. Check out <a href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2014/08/22/cinnamon-salad-dressing/\">farmers markets</a> or specialty markets, preferably organic where you will find foods grown in the different soils of different organic farms. At <a href=\"https://momsorganicmarket.com/our-ingredients/\">Mom&#8217;s Organic Market</a>, you can find produce that is like going to a good farmer&#8217;s market where you find more unusual produce and it&#8217;s not over washed and that has avoided cross contamination in a warehouse with vegetables treated with pesticides.</p>\n<p>All the things you&#8217;ve heard before that are &#8216;good for you&#8217; take on a new meaning as you study how the human body is returned to proper function. It&#8217;s not easy to fit all of them into our lives. If you can see how they can make a difference in your quality of life, giving them a try and adding a new health routine becomes easier. While you are feeding and caring for the various microbe crews doing their jobs in your powerhouse, you will notice so many more friendly foods and enjoy their rainbow of colors and tastes and you will become emotionally attached to them. You will see &#8216;variety is the spice of life&#8217; in a new way.</p>\n<p>Eating raw vegetables provides a small amount of probiotics, a lot of prebiotic fiber, enzymes that help with digestion, and vital nutrients. Cooked vegetables still have prebiotic fiber but in general lose some of their nutrition. There are exceptions where they have more nutrition and some taste better and some are easier to digest when they are cooked. The cooked version of a vegetable and the raw version are different foods to the microbes, adding to the variety of foods you&#8217;re feeding them.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1397.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16619\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1397.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_1397-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<p>(Pictured: green leaf lettuce, carrot tops chopped fine, cauliflower sliced thin, carrots sliced and grated, red cabbage thinly sliced, grated Japanese sweet potato, fresh basil leaves, rolled together and sliced [chiffonade] and sliced rainbow swiss chard ribs.)</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_0582.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15726\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_0582.jpg 484w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_0582-227x300.jpg 227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px\" /></figure>\n<ul>\nPictured above:</p>\n<li>Artichoke is a little more exotic and you eat it differently than any other food. They are steamed 20 to 40 minutes depending on the size. Begin preparing them by cutting a 1/2 inch off the top and bottom. If you want to you can cut the sharp tips off the leaves with cooking scissors. Place them on the steam basket over the boiling water and cover. You can check for tenderness by grabbing one with tongs and turning it over and putting a fork in the heart. Another test people use is the leaves should remove easily. In time you&#8217;ll be able to tell just by the very olive color of a cooked artichoke. Transfer the artichoke to a large plate. Starting from the outside, the first rows of leaves are eaten by turning the leaf so the tender side is facing your lower teeth and pressing upper and lower teeth against the leaf as you slide it out, scraping the tender part off into your mouth. About half way through the artichoke, the entire bottom of the leaves will become tender and at one point you can start removing them in bunches by pinching the tops and pulling them off together, and then biting off the entire bottom. When you reach the end of the leaves, scoop off the inedible fuzz with a spoon, being careful not to remove part of the heart. You can dip everything in melted butter as you go.</li>\n<li>Jicama normally needs to have the outside skin cut off because it&#8217;s too stringy to chew.

Rather than grate it and get the bitter flavor all over everything, I slice it at an angle and set the pieces on the side of a salad and use it as a condiment like  pickles. Very often a medical plant looks like the organ it can help. The turmeric root resembles a part of the intestines and it&#8217;s very good for the gut.

Many vegetables can be eaten <a href=\"https://www.thediabetescouncil.com/the-craze-behind-root-to-stem-cooking-and-all-you-need-to-know/\">&#8216;root-to-stem&#8217;</a>. Great chefs are a part of the &#8216;root-to-stem&#8217; movement that has resulted in a whole new set of recipes that are very fun. The ribs and stems of vegetables are full of fiber and nutrition. Peels are another thing I&#8217;ve been throwing away and they are also full of nutrition. Cabbage cores can be grated for salads. I&#8217;m now only throwing away the part of vegetables that are tough. Try a piece and if you can&#8217;t chew it, then toss it or you can save parts of vegetables in the freezer to make a vegetable broth.<br />\nPictured above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Red butter lettuce is a delicate salad green.</li>\n<li>Cut up red kale from root to stem and steam or cut small and use in salads.</li>\n<li>Cut up Hakurei turnips from root-to-stem and add a small amount to salads.

I recommend using radish tops and turnips for the salad and choosing mostly sweet roots (like beets, jicama, parsnips, rutabaga, sweet potatoes, and carrots) and less bitter greens (like spinach, collards, swiss chard, and beet tops and celery tops) for smoothies. Pictured: spinach, collard greens and stems, apple, parsnip, white carrot, sweet potato, golden beet, parsley, green algae powder, malabar spinach, red carrot, Japanese sweet potato, rutabaga, swiss chard, celery and water.</p>\n<p>Adding unsweetened cacao nibs and whey protein powder or pea protein powder, if you can tolerate them (one is dairy and the other has lectins), are a delicious addition to smoothies and these protein isolates powders supply all eight amino acids for building the body. </p>\n<p>Please note:<br />\nThere&#8217;s a reason why you don&#8217;t see leaves on tomatoes at the store. They are poisonous. As you add new vegetables and fruits to your diet, keep in mind foods that some foods that are very nutritious but <b>should not be eaten raw </b>because they contain toxins that can make you very sick. Some of these toxins can be neutralized by proper preparation:</p>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>Chaya, a shrub native to Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula, is called &#8220;tree spinach.&#8221; The nutrients in these leaves were found to be an herbal remedy of a number of health ailments. But the raw leaves have toxic compounds. They are cooked for 20 minutes and served with butter or oil. Dr. Weil says not to cook them in aluminum pans.</li>\n<li>Yucca or cassava root contains cyanide and must be dried, soaked in water, rinsed and cook soon after harvesting. Like chaya, the leaves have a high concentration of cyanide to ward off bugs.</li>\n<li>Taro root is a superfood, full of healthy nutrients, but in its raw state it&#8217;s toxic due to its calcium oxalate content.</li>\n<li>Both the leaves and roots of taro have to be cooked. Boil, steam or bake them like potatoes. Dr. Mercola&#8217;s Food Facts states that &#8220;This plant contains needle-like calcium oxalate crystals, which can lead to extreme irritation in your throat and mouth, resulting in a burning and stinging sensation. If consumed without cooking it thoroughly, it may also result in gout and kidney stones.&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;A luscious looking olive, ripe off the sun-warmed tree, is horrible.<br />\nThe substance that renders it essentially inedible is oleuropein, a phenolic compound bitter enough to shrivel your teeth. The bitterness is a protective mechanism for olives, useful for fending off invasive microorganisms and seed-crunching mammals.&#8221; National Geographic</li>\n<li>*Raw wild mushrooms have all different kinds of toxins that are neutralized when cooked. The list is short for the mushrooms that are considered edible raw but people can still have a reaction to the small amount of toxins that can be in these. There debate continues on these so it appears that there is not a lot of concern about white, crimini, enokis and portabella.</li>\n<li>The lectins in beans are too strong in the raw state. They have to be cook and it&#8217;s best to do this using a pressure cooker.</li>\n<li>Bad bacteria can be growing on sprouted seeds that begins during the sprouting process itself. They are risky to eat raw.</li>\n<li>Non-sweet potatoes like russets, yukon gold, red, fingerlings have a strong toxin called solanine. There is more of this compound when they have started to turn green and sprout. Do not eat them raw.</li>\n<li>Rice has arsenic but not enough to take it off the shelves. Arsenic-based pesticides were heavily used on crops for decades and new crops absorb the arsenic from the water and soil. Brown rice has the most. White basmati is the best choice. Soaking rice overnight draws arsenic out. Then rise it well.</li>\n<li>Even cooking rhubarb leaves does not get rid of its oxalic acid that is used to make bleach and anti-rust products. Do not eat rhubarb leaves.</li>\n<li>The seeds of apples, mangoes, peaches, pears and apricots have cyanide and like rhubarb leaves should not be eaten at all.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Lightly sprinkle with salt, garlic powder, dried parsley and basil. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 16 minutes. Keep and eye on it. Wild salmon, more so than Atlantic salmon, gets very tough and flavorless if it&#8217;s overcooked. You want it nice and tender.<br />\n*Salmon is cut through the middle horizontally, bones removed and then either cut across into 3&#8243; fillets, or they package it in the long pieces.</p>\n<h3>Pesto</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1/3 cup pine nuts</li>\n<li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>\n<li>2 ounces (1 1/2 lightly packed cups) basil leaves</li>\n<li>1 clove garlic, sliced</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Put pesto ingredients in food processor and process/pulse just enough so you can still see the pieces of basil and finely chopped nuts.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0943-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16147\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0943-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_0943-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MG_6205.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16142\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MG_6205.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MG_6205-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/new-lettuce2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16144\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/new-lettuce2.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/new-lettuce2-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_1243.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16145\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_1243.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_1243-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_5749.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-16149\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_5749.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_5749-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n",

We&#8217;ve been snapping off, cutting off and throwing away part of vegetables that we thought we weren&#8217;t supposed to eat, and there is a root-to-stem movement that is re-educating us and offering great recipes for the &#8216;scapes&#8217; we&#8217;ve been discarding, some of which, it turns out, have more nutrition than the part of the vegetable we&#8217;ve been eating. Someone mentioned that she saves vegetable parts in the freezer until soup day. What a great idea! Brown the scrapes with onions, add water and simmer. You won&#8217;t be being wasteful anymore and you will save on your food budget and have fun with new recipe ideas.  </p>\n<p>Steaming is an easy, simple way to cook all the parts of vegetables. And what you don&#8217;t want to steam, you can save for the vegetable broth. Vegetables are delicious steamed then served with a sprinkle of salt and some butter or olive oil. Cooking greens this way is turned into something fun by adding the stems or ribs that, if you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ve been throwing away not realizing they were not only edible, but tasty. Give tougher stems a head start in the steamer, then add the more tender leaves. Kale stems/ribs and leaves cook the same and also collard stems/ribs and leaves. The cooking times are all different depending on how tender the greens and stems are. </p>\n<p>Rainbow swiss chard is loaded with <a href=\"https://www.livestrong.com/article/489291-rainbow-chard-nutritional-value/\">nutrition</a> — fiber, vitamins A, C, E and K, iron and phytochemicals. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_1372.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15893\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_1372.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_1372-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h4>Root-to-Stem Swiss Chard</h4>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>1 bunch swiss chard</li>\n<li>butter</li>\n<li>salt</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Using a knife, cut down the sides of the middle ribs of each leaf.

Remove lid and add the leaves. Cover and steam until desired tenderness. Check at 5 minutes to see if it&#8217;s done, then check again every couple minutes after that. Serve sprinkled with salt and with a dollop of butter or drizzled with olive oil.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_1384.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15894\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_1384.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_1384-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_8567.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15953\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_8567.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_8567-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/rainbow-chard.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18017\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/rainbow-chard.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/rainbow-chard-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_8542.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-15955\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_8542.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_8542-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_2233.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18019\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_2233.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_2233-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_8586.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-15954\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_8586.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_8586-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_2231.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18020\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_2231.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_2231-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_6612.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-18022\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_6612.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/IMG_6612-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/27009660973_d8c2c335d3_kcrop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15923\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/27009660973_d8c2c335d3_kcrop.jpg 445w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/27009660973_d8c2c335d3_kcrop-209x300.jpg 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/8837939828_64ad8c4a21_h-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15932\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/8837939828_64ad8c4a21_h-1.jpg 445w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/8837939828_64ad8c4a21_h-1-209x300.jpg 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/32581921456_7f6192cd5b_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15940\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/32581921456_7f6192cd5b_o.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/32581921456_7f6192cd5b_o-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/14523972029_5c516c5417_k.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-15926\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/14523972029_5c516c5417_k.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/14523972029_5c516c5417_k-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<p>&#8220;On the third day He rose again from the dead&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8216;Our Lady of Paris&#8217;

I make it and freeze it in 3 ounce packages and add it to salads with chopped cilantro (photo below). You can also cook the chicken and set it aside. Roast some vegetables (see directions below), add the chicken and top with chopped cilantro.   </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_1096s.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15775\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_1096s.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_1096s-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h4>Paleo Marinaded Chicken</h4>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>4 large chicken breasts, each sliced into two flat pieces, then sliced through the middle, then sliced into 1/3&#8243; inch slivers</li>\n<li>1/4 cup avocado oil</li>\n<li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>\n<li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>\n<li>2 teaspoons Garam Masala</li>\n<li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>\n<li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Place the chicken pieces in a glass bowl.

      "rendered": "<p>Using sweet potatoes for a quiche crust and using all whipping cream makes this a super yummy Paleo comfort food.</p>\n<p>There was a bit of a learning curve to be able to use a quiche pan with a removable bottom without a traditional crust because of the filling leaking. We learn so much by making mistakes so making things over and over until I&#8217;m pleased with a recipe to me is an adventure. No matter how I did it, I felt they all worked. Here&#8217;s what I found as I played around with this one. </p>\n<p>Using different amounts of potato slices was all okay but the cooking time needed to be adjusted depending on how many and how thick they were. Also the thickness of the potato slices makes a difference in how flat they lay and how long you cook them. I experimented with two different mandolines to slice the sweet potatoes. The thinnest setting for the second one cut thicker slices than the other mandoline. The thinker slices curled more. If your pieces stay flat, you can skip having to use pie weights. Just brush on the butter and cook the crust as is. If the slices are curling, you will want to place a piece of parchment or foil over the crust and fill it with pie weights or dry beans. Doing this will require additional prebaking the &#8216;crust&#8217; cooking time. The potatoes need to be tender before the filling goes in the crust.</p>\n<p>Using a sweet potato crust instead of a normal flour crust in a quiche pan with removable bottom leaks because the filling gets through the slices. It amounts to 1/4 cup of cooked custard which was still a bit messy even with a pice of foil under the pan keeping it from spilling in the oven, but I wouldn&#8217;t say it doesn&#8217;t work to do it this way if you want to. However, make a liner by putting parchment paper in the pan that is large enough cover the bottom and go up the sides will stop this. You will still want the foil bed the pan sits in. </p>\n<p>Using a quiche pan will give you the classic quiche look and the thin slices of sweet potato are very pretty around the edges, but you can also use a normal pie plate and not have any of the extra trouble. Do the same thing; whole slices of sweet potato on the bottom and half slices around the sides.      </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0446sm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15407\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0446sm.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0446sm-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h2>Sweet Potato Crust</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>2 medium size sweet potatoes*</li>\n<li>1/4 cup butter, divided</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>You will be using half the butter to grease an 11&#8243; quiche pan or 10&#8243; pie pan, and melt the other half to brush onto the &#8216;crust.&#8217; Peel sweet potatoes and slice very thin using a mandoline slicer. Lay overlapping slices in concentric circles. Cut circles in half for the sides. The slices should all overlap enough so they are two layers thick and will still cover the pan completely when they shrink as they cook. Make a foil bed to place the quiche pan in. Brush the assembled crust with the melted butter. (Add parchment or foil and pie weights if the slices are curling a lot.) Bake the crust in a 350 degree oven for 30 &#8211; 45 minutes depending on the thickness of the slices, how many layers of slices there are, and whether you are using pie weights. Bring it out of the oven and place on a cookie rack and, using a spoon, press the sides back up straight if they have slid down.<br />\n*Use up any leftover potato in salads by cutting the slices into julienne pieces.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0375sm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15324\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0375sm.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0375sm-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0379.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15326\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0379.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0379-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0430.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15411\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0430.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0430-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0432.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-15412\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0432.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0432-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n</figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0386.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-15332\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0386.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0386-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Filling 1 (Quiche Lorraine)</h3>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>3/4 &#8211; 1 cup cooked bacon (6 pieces of turkey or 8 pieces of pork)</li>\n<li>1 1/2 cups shredded Jarlsberg cheese</li>\n<li>1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>\n<li>4 eggs</li>\n<li>1 1/2 cups whipping cream</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>pinch of nutmeg</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Saute onion in butter for 5 minutes until translucent but not brown. Place the shredded cheese and the bacon on the crust. Blend the cream, milk, eggs, onion mixture and nutmeg and pour over the cheese and bacon.* Bake in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes. Remove from oven to a cookie rack and let rest 10 minutes. The filling leaks out when you use a spring form quiche pan and it&#8217;s a little messy, but it cuts well and the crust is really pretty.<br />\n*I reserve 3/4 cup of the filling in a measuring cup with a handle. I place the quiche in the oven and then pour it over the rest. This way I don&#8217;t have to worry about tilting the quiche and having the filling spill onto the crust.

Add the grated almond paste and process 1 minutes until blended.<br />\nPlace the yoghurt, egg, butter and extracts in a medium bowl and whisk together. Add the dry mixture to the yoghurt mixture using a fork. It will be like a heavy, sticky dough.<br />\nFill the muffin pan about 2/3&#8217;s full and make a slight indentation in the middle of each muffin. Spoon a heaping teaspoon of raspberry or strawberry jam in the indentation. With the remaining &#8216;dough&#8217; make 1 1/2 &#8211; 2&#8243; caps of dough with your fingers and place them over the jelly. Press all around the sides of the caps to seal the dough.<br />\nBake in a 375 degree oven for 16 minutes or until lightly browned. Don&#8217;t overcook or they will be dry.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0485.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15432\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0485.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_0485-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7640.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15446\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7640.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7640-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7600.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15451\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7600.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7600-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7604.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-15443\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7604.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7604-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7599.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-15444\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7599.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7599-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7623.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15440\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7623.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7623-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7664.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15456\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7664.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7664-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7606.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-15442\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7606.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_7606-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_E7754-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15514\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_E7754-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_E7754-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n</figure>\n",

If you&#8217;ve been intimidated to make Béarnaise, with the invention of various blenders, it&#8217;s become a much easier to make.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to do it. Some are successfully doing it in a pan directly on the stove. Whatever works for you is the right way. Before there were blenders or immersion hand blenders, I was making béarnaise in a bowl over very warm water using a whisk. There&#8217;s a &#8216;feel&#8217; to mastering making hollandaise, always having to be very careful to do it just right every time. The same is true when you use a machine to do the mixing. You still need to follow every step to avoid the disappointment of runny sauce, or worse, sauce that gets too hot and the eggs curdle and separate from the butter. This recipe is for doing it the old fashioned way using a bowl over water which I find to be much easier, less of a mess and less apt to not thicken.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve already made hollandaise, then you already know what you are doing but you will have to find the right addition of the vinegar, wine herb reduction, just has you had to find the amount of lemon juice that you preferred for your hollandaise.</p>\n<p>Most of the recipes you find for béarnaise sauce are made with tarragon. The French way is made with two herbs, tarragon, and one that is more difficult to find, chervil (French parsley). I didn&#8217;t know this until I did some research. Now I&#8217;m curious and I&#8217;ll be on the lookout for the second herb needed to make an authentic béarnaise. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Béarnaise sauce is a sauce made of clarified butter emulsified in egg yolks and white wine vinegar and flavored with herbs. It is considered to be a &#8216;child&#8217; of the mother Hollandaise sauce, one of the five mother sauces in the French haute cuisine repertoire. The difference is only in the flavoring: Béarnaise uses shallot, chervil, peppercorns, and tarragon in a reduction of vinegar and wine, while Hollandaise is more stripped down, using a reduction of lemon juice or white wine. Its name is related to the province of Béarn, France.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Béarnaise is a traditional sauce for steak.&#8221;<br />\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Béarnaise_sauce\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0411f-sm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15393\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0411f-sm.jpg 495w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0411f-sm-232x300.jpg 232w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px\" /></figure>\n<p>Shown with <a href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2014/10/27/easy-pot-roast-and-mashed-cauliflower-with-boursin-herbed-cheese-2/\">mashed cauliflower</a> and braised asparagus. </p>\n<h3>Hollandaise Sauce</h3>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>4 egg yolks</li>\n<li>4 tablespoons hot water</li>\n<li>1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) of butter</li>\n<li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>\n<p>Melt the butter in a small pan that works for pouring the butter out without it running down the pan and on the counter. I have a lipped sauce pan that works very well. One with an indentation for pouring is ideal. Test your pots using water. You don&#8217;t want to be in the middle of blending, having to switch the butter to another pan. I set the pan back on the warm burner to keep the melted butter hot as I&#8217;m doing the incorporating. If the butter isn&#8217;t hot enough, the mixture won&#8217;t thicken.</p>\n<p>Place a stainless steal bowl over a pan with simmering water. Place the three yolks in the warm bowl and whisk for 10 seconds. Add the hot water 1 tablespoon at the time. The mixture will become a little frothy but will not thicken yet. After the water is added, begin pouring in the hot butter slowly whisking constantly. When you&#8217;ve added about 1/2 to 3/4&#8217;s of it, the mixture will thicken. If at any time the eggs start to look like they are cooking, quickly remove the bowl from the pan to the counter to cool it down as you continue whisking. </p>\n<p>For béarnaise add the cooled tarragon mixture below. </p>\n<h3>Tarragon Reduction</h3>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>\n<li>1/4 cup white wine</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons chopped tarragon, divided</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons chopped shallots</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Place the vinegar, wine, salt, pepper, shallots and 1 tablespoon of the chopped tarragon in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and let boil for about 5 minutes or until the liquid has reduced to 2 tablespoons. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of tarragon to the reduction and set it aside while you make the hollandaise.</p>\n<p>Note: Many recipes will tell you that hollandaise and béarnaise can&#8217;t be kept in the refrigerator and reheated. But they can be if you handle them correctly, and are very careful not to overheat them. Do not keep the sauce at room temperature for an extended length of time because of the egg yolks. If not using right away, transfer the sauce from the blender container to a glass jar. Put the jar in the refrigerator immediately (it won&#8217;t be very hot) and it can be reheated directly from the refrigerator. Create a bain-marie by setting the jar in a pan of very warm (but not hot) water to reheat, stirring often. If the water is too hot, the eggs will cook and the sauce will separate.</p>\n<p>Hollandaise can be made in a blender or immersion hand blender but I think it&#8217;s more difficult.  </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0398.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15342\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0398.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0398-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0505s.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15465\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0505s.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_0505s-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MG_0016bearnaise.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15492\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MG_0016bearnaise.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MG_0016bearnaise-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><a href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2019/01/28/bearnaise-sauce/_mg_4665-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-15494\"><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MG_4665-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15494\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MG_4665-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MG_4665-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></a></figure>\n<p>Béarnaise is delicious on fish as well as steak.

      "rendered": "<p>&#8220;Monkey bread, also called monkey puzzle bread, sticky bread, Hungarian coffee cake, golden dumpling coffee cake, pinch-me cake, and pluck-it cake is a soft, sweet, sticky pastry served in the United States for breakfast or as a treat. It consists of pieces of soft baked dough sprinkled with cinnamon. It is often served at fairs and festivals.<br />\nThe origin of the term &#8216;monkey bread&#8217; comes from the pastry being a finger food: the consumer would pick apart the bread as a monkey would.<br />\nWhat most people know as monkey bread today in the United States is actually the Hungarian dessert arany galuska [&#8220;golden dumpling&#8221;]. Dating back to the 1880s in Hungarian literature, Hungarian immigrants brought this dish with them when they immigrated to America and began introducing it into the country&#8217;s food landscape when Hungarian and Hungarian Jewish bakeries began selling it in the mid-twentieth century.<br />\nIn 1972, a cookbook published by Betty Crocker included a recipe for arany galuska, which they referred to as &#8216;Hungarian Coffee Cake&#8217;. As it became more popular in America, arany galuska came to be confused with monkey bread in which the balls of dough are not dipped in cinnamon and sugar but only in butter {&#8216;butter monkey bread&#8217;}. &#8216;Monkey bread&#8217; soon became the more common name for this Hungarian Jewish dessert.<br />\nRecipes for the {butter monkey} bread first appeared in American women&#8217;s magazines and community cookbooks in the 1950s, but the dish is still virtually unknown outside the United States.&#8221;<br />\nWikipedia<br />\nIt&#8217;s thought that the butter version began and became popular in California in the 40&#8217;s. The food icon and former Neiman Marcus food services director Helen Corbitt contributed a butter monkey bread recipe for the store&#8217;s grand opening in 1967.<br />\nThe term &#8216;monkey bread&#8217; is now used for both the coffee cake and the no cinnamon or sugar dinner roll versions. Most monkey bread recipes include cinnamon and brown sugar and a glaze which is delicious but the plain bread under all that has a flavor that is unique from any other bread that is mmmmm&#8230; so good. You will find a garlic bread version below which is also really good.<br />\nMany of the recipes online are also using store bought biscuits which is much easier and wouldn&#8217;t matter if you were doing the coffee cake version with the cinnamon, sugar and glaze. Doing it from scratch is more trouble but this food processor recipe my mom adapted from my grandmother&#8217;s recipe makes it much easier and you can enjoy the very special flavor of butter only monkey bread.     </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_0287s.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15166\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_0287s.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_0287s-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h2>Butter Monkey Bread</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>\n<li>1/4 cup sugar</li>\n<li>2 eggs</li>\n<li>1 envelope yeast</li>\n<li>3 1/4 cups (plus flour for handling dough)</li>\n<li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>6 tablespoons cold butter and 3/4 cup melted butter</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>You will need 2 small bundt pans. I&#8217;ve tried both the lighter and the dark, non-stick interiors and for my oven the darker works better.<br />\nPlace the milk and sugar in a sauce pan over medium high heat. When milk has risen quickly up the pan and formed a skin (&#8216;scalds&#8217;) remove from heat. Cool to a little warmer than lukewarm. Sprinkle the yeast over the milk and let the yeast begin to bubble (&#8216;proofing&#8217;). It takes between 5 and 10 minutes depending on the temperature of the milk and the room.<br />\nWhile the yeast is proofing, place 3 cups (16 oz) of flour, and the salt in a food processor bowl and get the cold butter ready by cutting it in about 6 pieces, keeping it cold in the refrigerator, ready to put in the processor.<br />\nOnce the yeast has proofed, gently beat in the 2 eggs using a fork.<br />\nPlace the cold butter on the flour in the processor and process until blended. Add the milk mixture and process. Add 1/4 cup flour and process. Cover the processor with a dry dish towel and let rise until double in bulk, about an hour depending on the temperature.<br />\nHave the melted butter ready. When the dough has finished rising, turn the processor on briefly to &#8216;punch&#8217; the dough down. Use the remaining 1 tablespoon of flour to flour your hands so you can remove the processor blade so you don&#8217;t risk cutting yourself while you are making the balls of dough. You&#8217;ll be working with dough that is very sticky so it&#8217;s necessary to dip your fingers in a bowl with flour or in the butter before you pinch of the pieces of dough to make the balls. Pinch out 1&#8243; to 1 1/2&#8243; pieces and mold them with your fingers or in your hand and then dip them in the melted butter, placing them in two small bundt pans or ovenproof ring molds. As you place them in the pans, start with a row at the bottom of each pan, placing the pieces of dough 1/2&#8243; apart, then adding pieces in between until all the dough is gone. I make a layer in one pan, then a layer in the other, going back and forth to make sure I get the same amount in each pan.<br />\nPour the remaining butter over the pieces, dividing it evenly between the two pans.<br />\nPlace the pans together, cover with wax paper and the dry kitchen towel. Let rise until double in bulk, about 2/3&#8217;s way up the pan. Do not over-rise. This rising time can go very quickly because of the warmth of the butter, usually only 20 -30 minutes.<br />\nHave the oven preheated to 400 degrees and ready. Bake for 15 minutes. Let cool in pans 5 minutes, then invert onto serving plates.<br />\nThey should be brown on the bottom, not doughy which becomes more of an issue with light colored pans like tin or aluminum. If they come out doughy slide them on to a cookie sheet and put them back in the oven and they will brown up nicely. But be sure not to overcook them.<br />\nDarker pans, the material of the pans, and the position of the racks in the oven, gas or electric oven — all make a difference.<br />\nFor garlic bread, mix 1 1/2 tablespoon of minced green onion with the 1/4 cup of flour and mix 3 small minced garlic cloves with the melted butter and sprinkle a total of 1/2 cup parmesan cheese over the balls of dough, dividing it between the two layers.  </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_0227-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full

      "rendered": "<p>Fresh sage, rosemary and vermouth gives these turkey meatballs a wonderful holiday flavor. The meatballs, sweet potato &#8216;noodles&#8217; and alfredo sauce are all on a low carb paleo diet ingredients list. They are very versatile.<br />\nThe meatballs keep well. They are a little tedious to make because of all the chopping so I make a double batch and divide them into individual packages and put them in the freezer. For non-paleo, they are great on regular noodles with a pasta sauce and grated parmesan cheese. While creating a menu with these, you can also think of them like you would meatloaf. They are good with any kind of potato dish and steamed or roasted vegetables. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8243f-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13317\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8243f-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8243f-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h2>Meatballs Alla Bolognese</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<p>This recipe can be made in larger batches and frozen.</p>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>1 lb ground turkey</li>\n<li>1/2 cup carrot, chopped fine</li>\n<li>1/3 cup celery, chopped fine</li>\n<li>1 cup onion, chopped fine</li>\n<li>4 medium mushrooms (2 ounces), chopped fine</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>\n<li>1 egg, slightly beaten</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons red vermouth</li>\n<li>2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary</li>\n<li>2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh sage</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_8442-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14223\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_8442-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_8442-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p> Heat the butter and oil and sauté carrot, celery, onion and mushrooms until soft, about 10 -15 minutes. Add the vermouth and cook until almost dry. Cool. Place the meat in a large bowl and add the egg, herbs, salt and vegetable mixture and mix together. Chilling the meat and then using an ice cream scoop with a thumb lever makes it easier to handle and to made the meatballs even. Place the meatballs on a roasting pan to catch drippings. Bake in a 350 degree oven until fully cooked, about 25 minutes depending on the size of your meatballs.  </p>\n<p>Can be served on spaghetti with pasta sauce or on sweet potato &#8220;noodles&#8221; with or without Alfredo Sauce (below).</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8487.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13407\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8487.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8487-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8497.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13457\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8497.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8497-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8080-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13332\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8080-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8080-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8025.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13333\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8025.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_8025-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_9997-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13337\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_9997-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MG_9997-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/onions-in-basket2-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13294\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/onions-in-basket2-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/onions-in-basket2-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/onions-in-basket2.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_5178.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14343\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_5178.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_5178-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/meatballs-bolognese7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13416\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/meatballs-bolognese7.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/meatballs-bolognese7-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_5833-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14965\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_5833-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_5833-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6716.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14956\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6716.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6716-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\nArt by J.

      "rendered": "<p>While looking through the spice cabinet last week, I took particular notice of a jar of herbs de Provence. It was something I&#8217;d never cooked with before but I knew it was something special in the history of French cooking. I wanted to know more about it so I looked up the name.</p>\n<p>Sur La Table&#8217;s website said that &#8220;Herbs de Provence is a blend of dried herbs frequently used in southern French cooking, and always contains thyme, savory, marjoram and oregano in equal proportions. Lavender flowers are often added and occasionally lesser quantities of other herbs can be included.&#8221; Wikipedia adds one more herb to the basic list, rosemary, and says cooking with these herbs is considered typical of, specifically, the Provence region of southeast France. The herbs were each measured separately and it wasn&#8217;t until the 1970&#8217;s that the commercial blends of the herbs began to be sold under the name herbs de Provence. The addition of lavender to the blend started in Northern America. The Trader Joe’s version I was holding was a blend of thyme, marjoram, savory, rosemary, basil, sage (instead of oregano) and lavender.  </p>\n<p>As I began to research a good recipe for the herb blend, I started with going through my mother’s cooking classes, knowing she was a trained in French cooking where she would have been introduced to this blend of herbs. There I came across this recipe for Chicken Olney, a split, stuffed and roasted chicken, which she learned to make at Tante Marie&#8217;s Cooking School in San Francisco. It was one of her favorite recipes to cook for special occasions. Another family favorite was (and still is) Chicken Gary. Knowing the latter recipe was named after a local chef, I researched the name Olney. He turned out to be a big deal and a very interesting read on the internet. </p>\n<p>Richard Olney (1927-1999) was an American painter, food writer and sought after wine and food pairing expert, best known for his books on French country cooking. He was born in Iowa, and first moved to France in 1951, in Paris, and spent a majority of his adult life living in a house above the village Solliès-Toucas in Provence, France. He was considered one of the most influential food writers of his era having a huge impact on nouvelle cuisine and California cuisine, befriending a number of influential foodies of the day both in France and the States. He was a contemporary of James Beard (1903-1985) and taught cooking classes in Beard’s home. Beard was an American cook, cookbook author, teacher who mentored generations of professional chefs. I once visited his a restaurant he owned in New Orleans and I bought his Cajun cookbook and made his wonderful turtle pralines many times. </p>\n<p>My mother Grayce Flanagan (1927-2018), a culinary arts instructor who taught in private homes and culinary store schools in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas, was a contemporary of these food geniuses and part of the California cuisine movement which was infusing different cuisines and promoting using fresh local produce and other local food.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/ricotta-and-herb-stuffed-chicken-238929\">Epicurious</a> was inspired by Olney&#8217;s &#8216;spatchcocked,&#8217; or butterflied, and stuffed roasted chicken recipe. They left out the zucchini replacing it with additional ricotta. They say the creamier stuffing has a &#8220;popover or soufflé type of texture.&#8221; You will also notice that their recipe calls for fresh oregano and parsley and no dried herbs. <a href=\"https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/ricotta_stuffed_chicken/\">Simply Recipes</a> also uses all ricotta and their herbs are fresh basil and tarragon. They have a video to show you how to spatchcock the chicken. </p>\n<p>This following recipe my mother taught in her classes was the one from Tante Marie Cooking School, which used less butter and has some short cuts. Richard Olney&#8217;s original recipe is below along with some of his introduction to the recipe. There are several pages of introduction and information and the book lists some other filling suggestions. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0078s.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14976\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0078s.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_0078s-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h2>Chicken Olney With Lavender</h2>\n<ul>\n<h3>Ingredients </h3>\n<li>1 3 1/2 lb chicken, butterflied (spatchcocked*)</li>\n<li>olive oil</li>\n<li>salt and pepper</li>\n<li>1 medium onion, diced into small pieces</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons butter</li>\n<li>1 pound grated zucchini</li>\n<li>salt and pepper</li>\n<li>1/4 cup ricotta cheese</li>\n<li>1 egg, slightly beaten</li>\n<li>1 1/2 teaspoons herbs de Provence</li>\n<li>1/4 cup parmesan reggiano</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Cook onion in butter until soft. Add zucchini and sauté until water is removed. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add the ricotta cheese, egg, herbs de Provence and parmesan cheese. Cool.<br />\nSpatchcock the chicken by removing the backbone of the chicken {or cutting down one side of it},  turning the chicken breast side up, and flattening it, breaking the bones underneath {Or grab both sides and pull each of them back. The bones will loosen so it lays flat and the full legs and thighs are facing up so you can stuff them}. Carefully loosen the skin from the meat using your fingers, then stuff handfuls of the zucchini mixture under the skin, legs, and thighs and breasts {To keep the skin from tearing you can move the filling into place in the legs and thighs from the outside}. Mold chicken around legs and thighs to look like a chicken. Rub with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper {and a sprinkle of herbs} and place on a roasting pan. </p>\n<p>This can all be done ahead of time and chilled. Roast in a 375 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours {start checking at 1 hour and 15 minutes} or until inside reaches recommended poultry temperature. Let rest 10 minutes, carve and serve.</p>\n<p>Another filling to try is replacing the zucchini and onion with a leek and an 8 ounce box of mushrooms, cooking them the same way, letting the juices be released and then waiting for the mixture to dry but not letting it brown. Adding some vermouth if you like and let that cook down. Then mix in 2 tablespoons chopped parsley.<br />\n*<a href=\"https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/ricotta_stuffed_chicken/\">Simply Recipes</a> has a video to show you how to spatchcock a

classes.</p>\n<p>SPLIT, STUFFED, BAKED CHICKEN</p>\n<p>1 split chicken, skin loosened<br />\nMarinade<br />\n1 teaspoon crumbled mixed dried herbs (thyme, oregano and savory)<br />\n3 tablespoons olive oil<br />\nStuffing<br />\n3 ounces fresh white cheese (ricotta or cream cheese—or cheese may be replaced by 2 ounces soft bread crumbs, soaked and mashed with 1/3 cup heavy cream))<br />\n1/3 cup butter (in all: 2 tablespoons for sautéing zucchini; 1 tablespoon for stewing onion; the remainder for the stuffing<br />\nSalt, pepper<br />\nLarge pinch of finely chopped fresh marjoram leaves and flowers (If unavailable use fine herbes)<br />\n1 egg<br />\n1 medium onion, finely chopped, stewed gently in butter for 15 minutes without coloring, cooled<br />\n1 pound small, firm zucchini, grated, juliènned, salted, squeezed, sautéed and cooled (see instructions below)<br />\nLarge handful freshly grated Parmesan</p>\n<p>Sprinkle the chicken on both sides (but not beneath the skin) with herbs, pat and rub generously with oil and leave to marinade for an hour or two.<br />\nSplit the chicken the entire length of the back, beginning at the tail, using heavy poultry shears and cutting it, as nearly as possible, through the center of the backbone. Open it out on a chopping board skin side up, the joints joining drumstick and thigh forced inward, facing. With the flat side of a mallet or cleaver — or with the heel of your hand flatten it out with a firm whack, fracturing breastbone, ribcage structure, collarbone, and wishbone.</p>\n<p>Mash the cheese and butter together with seasoning and herbs, using a fork; add the egg, mashing. Stir in the onion and zucchini, and, finally, the Parmesan, adding enough to bring the stuffing to a firm consistency.</p>\n<p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.</p>\n<p>Loosen the skin of the chicken, starting at the neck end. The skin is securely attached by tendons only at the breastbone, drumstick tips, and along the backbone. Elsewhere only fragile and easily ruptured membranes keep the skin and flesh together. Work first with the fingertips then with your whole hand, loosening the skin from one breast, then the thigh and finally the drumstick. Repeat on the other side.</p>\n<p>Stuff the chicken, taking a handful of stuffing at a time and forcing it into place, with the fingers of one hand beneath the skin while molding with the other from the outside. Coat drumsticks and thighs well before worrying about the breasts. When all the stuffing is in place, fold the neck-skin flap, if there is any, over the throat orifice and tuck it beneath the bird. With a small sharply pointed knife, pierce the web of skin and thin bleach between the inside of the thigh and the tip of the breast, making a slit just large enough to receive the drumstick tip. Force the drumstick gently up and push its tip through the slit to the underside. Place the bird in its roasting pan (a large skillet or a round, shallow earthen ware baking dish are ideal receptacles) and mold the surface with your hands to force the skin and stuffing into a plump version of the natural form. Salt and pepper.</p>\n<p>Roast, starting at 450 degrees F and turning the oven down to 375 degrees F after 10 minutes. Start basting regularly after a half an hour. Count 50 minutes to 1 hour in all, depending on the size of the chicken, and if after about 40 minutes it seems to be coloring too rapidly, turn the oven down further, placing a sheet of foil over the bird.</p>\n<p>Transfer to a heated platter and carve at the table. Carving is easy; just cut in half down the middle, separate the breast and wing from the leg quarter, cut the leg into thigh and drumstick, and the cut the breast crosswise in two pieces, one with the wing attached.</p>\n<p>*Coarsely shred or grate the zucchini or put through the medium blade of the Mouli-juliènne, reducing them to spaghetti-like threads, arrange in layers in a mixing bowl, sprinting each layer with salt, and leave to stand for half an hour. Squeeze the juliènne with your hands—in the bowl and in its liquid—until it is swimming. Pour into a sieve, press to rid it of flagrant moisture, them form the mass into a ball and squeeze tightly and repeatedly between both hands until no more liquid may be wrung from it. Sauté in the butter over a medium flame for 7 to 8 minutes, tossing often and spreading the mass out again with a wooden spoon until well dried and lightly colored.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_6175-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13592\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_6175-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_6175-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n",

Place the pears in a large casserole, sprinkle with the lemon juice and mix to coat. Add the sweet potato and mix in the butter mixture. Spread the sweet potatoes and pears so they are in one layer. The casserole should be large enough so they aren&#8217;t overcrowded allowing for the juices to evaporate and the sauce to caramelize rather than steaming. Bake in a 400 degree oven for 40 minutes, stirring half way through.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9850.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14884\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9850.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9850-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9860.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14883\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9860.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9860-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MG_6241.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14822\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MG_6241.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/MG_6241-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pears6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14823\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pears6.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/pears6-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6666.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"640\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14943\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6608.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14837\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6608.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6608-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6618.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14838\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6618.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6618-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6619.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14839\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6619.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6619-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6623.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14841\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6623.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6623-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6593-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14847\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6593-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6593-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6599-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14851\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6599-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6599-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6598.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14859\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6598.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6598-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n</figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9875m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14890\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9875m.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9875m-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n",

I&#8217;d forgotten about it and rediscovered it along with a a few more recipes that were my favorites when I was making an index for all the recipes I&#8217;ve collected over the years and put into scrap books.</p>\n<p>I had also forgotten how delicious it is. I&#8217;d put it right up there with lasagne and tetrazzini as far as a great family or guest recipe but it only takes 30 minutes to put together which makes it pretty close to a perfect recipe.</p>\n<p>A project for the near future is going to see if it can be converted into a low carb and Paleo recipe by substituting a vegetable &#8216;noodle&#8217;, perhaps spaghetti squash, for the rice. But for now, this is what I made for my kids making one of those fond memories we all cherish from our moms and grandmothers.  </p>\n<h2>Chicken and Leeks Rice Casserole</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2 cups cooked chicken*, torn in pieces</li>\n<li>1 1/2 cups white rice</li>\n<li>2 1/4 to 3 cups chicken stock (use directions on rice package for amount of liquid)</li>\n<li>1 medium leek, white and light green part only, cut down the middle and each half cut down the middle, then bunched together and thinly sliced</li>\n<li>6 medium mushrooms, quartered or cut in small pieces</li>\n<li>1/2 cup butter</li>\n<li>1 cup heavy (whipping) cream</li>\n<li>white pepper</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Cook rice according to directions. Sauté leek and mushrooms in 1/2 cup butter for 10 minutes or until mushrooms have weeped and shrunk and leek is cooked.<br />\nPlace the rice in a casserole and stir in the leek mixture, chicken and cream and a light sprinkle of white pepper. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes. Stir casserole to fluff the rice.<br />\n*Leftover chicken roast or 2 chicken breasts, julienned, lightly salted, gently cooked in 1 tablespoon butter and olive oil just until the pink is gone so the meat is tender, then torn into bite size pieces.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9814.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14866\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9814.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9814-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9901.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15012\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9901.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9901-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9903-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15011\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9903-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9903-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6080.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14877\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6080.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_6080-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MG_6231-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14651\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MG_6231-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MG_6231-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9148-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14879\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9148-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9148-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9929s-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15018\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9929s-2.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9929s-2-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n",

They can be a fun outing for the family or like going on a date with your loved one or your dog, or both, because very often you will come across a farmers market where they are serving specialty foods (for people and dogs) and you can sit and have a continental breakfast or lunch, listen to live music. Or you can take a loaf of freshly baked crusty bread, a pie or pastry home. </p>\n<p>A couple months ago I passed by a long line for a French bakery vendor and I stopped and watched as people who obviously had been there many times were ordering several of their favorites. One man told me he came by every Saturday for a ham and cheese croissant. I noticed that the vender kept those under the table and I asked for one, and also one apple, blueberry and cranberry orange muffin. At home I cut them all in pieces for everyone to share and the consensus was the cranberry orange muffin was especially good. After a little research and experimenting, this  gluten-free version sweetened with maple syrup emerged. Try them with a little butter. I have trouble eating only one. So good!  </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9744-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14814\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9744-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9744-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h2>Maple Orange Cranberry Muffins</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 cup dried cranberries*, divided</li>\n<li>1/2 cup water</li>\n<li>1 cup oat flour</li>\n<li>1 cup white rice flour</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>2/3 cup maple syrup</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>\n<li>1 large egg</li>\n<li>zest of two oranges, finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon)</li>\n<li>1/2 cup orange juice</li>\n<li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Place the cranberries and water in a small saucepan over low heat and cook 5 minutes, remove from heat and cool. Measure flours, baking powder and soda and salt into one bowl, mixing them together. Measure the maple syrup, vanilla, egg, orange zest and juice and coconut milk into another bowl and whisk them together. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients. Fold in 3/4 cup cranberries. The consistency of the batter will be a little more liquid than pancake batter. </p>\n<p>Spoon batter into generously buttered muffin pan. If you are using muffins liners, you will be filling them almost all the way to the brim. Place the remaining berries on the top. Bake in a 375 degree oven for 18-20 minutes.<br />\n*Some dried cranberries are large and need to be out in half. Trader Joes are small.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8628-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13483\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8628-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8628-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3863421023_d1497fa324_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14099\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3863421023_d1497fa324_b.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3863421023_d1497fa324_b-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/orange-muffins.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14707\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/orange-muffins.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/orange-muffins-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n</figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/nhoulihan/3863421023/in/photolist\">Photo or cranberries by InAweofGod&#8217;sCreation</a></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MG_8003.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14708\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MG_8003.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MG_8003-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/16306193652_b7387d8f86_o-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14104\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/16306193652_b7387d8f86_o-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/16306193652_b7387d8f86_o-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/swallowtailgardenseeds/16306193652/in/photolist\">Photo of cranberries by Swallowtail Garden Seeds</a></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/maple-syrup.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14368\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/maple-syrup.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/maple-syrup-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/5575552096_0edaafddd1_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14369\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/5575552096_0edaafddd1_b.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/5575552096_0edaafddd1_b-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></p>\n<figure>\n<a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/masstravel/14107389276/in/photolist\">Photo by Massachusetts Office of Travel &#038; Tourism</a><br />\n<a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/evaing/5575552096/in/photolist\">Photo of maple tapping by evaingesl</a></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MG_4913.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14475\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MG_4913.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MG_4913-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9735-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14802\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9735-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_9735-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>This recipe was originally steamed vegetables with melted butter, maple syrup and spices and herbs. But, I had fallen in love with roasted vegetables. They&#8217;re just so fun to make and so pretty and yummy! Did I mention yummy!<br />\nIf you&#8217;ve tried roasting root vegetables and found them to be too bitter, it was probably because they needed to be smaller, among a few techniques needed to really enjoy them. Instead of cutting them 2&#8243; or 3&#8243; in size, cut them small. It makes a big change, not just in terms of taste but also presentation. The vegetables need to cook dry and not braising in fats or juices. The onions will slightly caramelize, the skins of the carrots (and radishes) will slightly blister and their color will be more saturated, and the vegetables will not taste greasy. </p>\n<p>Use parchment paper not foil to line the pan. Many recipes call for olive oil but for health reasons avocado oil is recommended because of its high (500 degree) smoking point. </p>\n<p>Some notes on roasting vegetables&#8230;<br />\nRoasted vegetables are a wonderful sweet and savory taste experience. After trying many different combinations of vegetables, I&#8217;ve found that the trick to mastering roasting is for each vegetable to be cut to the right size so they will be tender at the same time and not having to keep them all cooking because one is not tender yet. After some experimenting, I found that daikon radishes (white and purple and probably green too), parsnips, carrots and sweet potatoes all consistently cook fine when cut no more than an inch by a half and inch. Beets, rutabagas, kohlrabi, parsley roots and turnips are the ones that need to be cut no more than a half an inch. If it all goes right, the onions are slightly caramelized and all the vegetables come out sweet with only a hint of the naturally bitter undertone left in the vegetables that have them.  </p>\n<p>Doing vegetables this way is really fun and goes along side lamb or beef roasts or burgers, barbecued steak, roasted chicken or turkey and scrambled eggs — just about everything. Ideally, they need to be eaten right away.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been posting a series of combinations of roasted vegetables and have put this introduction with each of them hoping it will help everyone become successful at these really delicious and pretty side dishes.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9587p-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14671\" /></figure>\n<h2>Maple Roasted Delicata, Carrots, Parsnips and Peas</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<p>The amounts of each of the cut up vegetables will vary depending on the size you buy. A total of 6 cups of vegetables, plus the onions, works well for an 18 by 13 sheet pan. Don&#8217;t overcrowd of the vegetables will steam instead of caramelizing. </p>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>1/2 delicata squash, skin removed and cut in small 1/2&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>parts of different color carrots, peeled and sliced diagonally in 1/4&#8243; slices</li>\n<li>2 small parsnips, peeled and sliced diagonally in 1/4&#8243; slices or cut in 3/4&#8243; by 1/2&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>4 &#8211; 4 1/2 tablespoons avocado oil</li>\n<li>1 onion, cut into wedges</li>\n<li>3/4 cup petite peas, thawed</li>\n<li>salt</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>\n<li>1 1/2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon fresh herbs (oregano, chives, thyme)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Place the onion wedges in a small bowl and sprinkle with 1 1/2 &#8211; 2 tablespoons of oil depending on the size of the onion. Place the remaining vegetables and herbs of choice in a larger bowl and drizzle the remaining oil over them. Spread the onions on a parchment lined sheet pan. Roast them for in a 425 degree oven for 8 minutes. Meanwhile place the maple syrup, butter, cinnamon, nutmeg in a small pan and turn on low.  At 8 minutes, remove the onions from the oven pour the vegetables over the onions and stir them in spreading them evenly over the pan. Sprinkle with salt. Roast for 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven again and stir in the peas and the melted butter mixture. Roast another 10 to 15 minutes. Your roasting time will vary depending on the size you&#8217;ve cut them and the tenderness of the vegetable. </p>\n<p>Begin checking for tenderness at the 25 to 30 minute mark. I&#8217;ve found that the best way to do this is by sticking a fork in each kind of vegetable and tasting them. There&#8217;s a point where the onions have slightly caramelized and the vegetables have the wonderful roasted texture that is the ideal.</p>\n<figure><img

After trying many different combinations of vegetables, I&#8217;ve found that the trick to mastering roasting is for each vegetable to be cut to the right size so they will be tender at the same time and not having to keep them all cooking because one is not tender yet. After some experimenting, I found that daikon radishes (white and purple and probably green too), parsnips, carrots and sweet potatoes all consistently cook fine when cut no more than an inch by a half and inch. Beets, rutabagas, kohlrabi, parsley root, and turnips are the ones that need to be cut no more than a half an inch. If it all goes right, the onions are slightly caramelized and all the vegetables come out sweet with only a hint of the naturally bitter undertone left in the vegetables that have them.  </p>\n<p>Doing vegetables this way is really fun and goes along side lamb or beef roasts or burgers, barbecued steak, roasted chicken or turkey and scrambled eggs — just about everything. Ideally, they need to be eaten right away.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be posting a series of combinations of roasted vegetables and will be putting this introduction with each of them hoping it will help everyone become successful at these really delicious and pretty side dishes.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9671-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14550\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9671-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9671-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9671-1.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h2>Roasted Potatoes, Celery Root, Carrots and Peas</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<p>The amounts of each of the cut up vegetables will vary depending on the size you buy. A total of 6 cups of vegetables, plus the onions, works well for an 18 by 13 sheet pan. Don&#8217;t overcrowd of the vegetables will steam instead of caramelizing.</p>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>white or red potatoes, cut in 3/4&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>carrots, peeled and sliced diagonally in 1/4&#8243; slices</li>\n<li>1 celery root, peeled and cut into 1/2&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>1 onion, cut into wedges</li>\n<li>4 &#8211; 4 1/2 tablespoons avocado oil</li>\n<li>salt</li>\n<li>3/4 cup petite peas, thawed</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>\n<li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning or 2 tablespoons fresh herbs (oregano, rosemary, basil, thyme, marjoram)</li>\n<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Place the onion wedges in a small bowl and sprinkle with 1 1/2 &#8211; 2 tablespoons of oil depending on the size of the onion and mix with your fingers to coat all the pieces with oil. Place the remaining vegetables in a larger bowl and drizzle the remaining oil over them and spreading the oil over all the vegetables with your fingers. Spread the onions on a parchment lined sheet pan. Roast them in a 425 degree oven for 8 minutes. Remove the onions from the oven, pour the vegetables over the onions and stir them in spreading them evenly over the pan. Sprinkle with salt. Roast for 35 minutes. Meanwhile, place the butter, Italian seasoning and garlic in a small pan and turn on low to melt. Remove the pan from the oven and stir in the peas and the melted butter mixture. Roast another 10 to 15 minutes. Your roasting time will vary depending on the size you&#8217;ve cut them and the tenderness of the vegetable. </p>\n<p>Begin checking for tenderness at the 35 minute mark. I&#8217;ve found that the best way to do this is by sticking a fork in each kind of vegetable and tasting them. There&#8217;s a point where the onions have slightly caramelized and the vegetables have the wonderful roasted texture that is the ideal.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9618-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14505\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9618-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9618-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9618.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9632.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14500\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9632.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9632-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_0242.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14501\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_0242.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_0242-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/white-and-red-potatoes-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14511\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/white-and-red-potatoes-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/white-and-red-potatoes-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/celery-root.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14503\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/celery-root.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/celery-root-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_6161.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14504\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_6161.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_6161-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9634-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14518\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9634-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9634-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/not-used0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14507\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/not-used0.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/not-used0-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_5180.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14514\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_5180.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_5180-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/celery-rt.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14513\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/celery-rt.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/celery-rt-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9662-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14542\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9662-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9662-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n",

After trying many different combinations of vegetables, I&#8217;ve found that the trick to mastering roasting is for each vegetable to be cut to the right size so they will be tender at the same time and not having to keep them all cooking because one is not tender yet. After some experimenting, I found that daikon radishes (white and purple and probably green too), parsnips, carrots and sweet potatoes all consistently cook fine when cut no more than an inch by a half and inch. Beets, rutabagas, kohlrabi, parsley root, and turnips are the ones that need to be cut no more than a half an inch. If it all goes right, the onions are slightly caramelized and all the vegetables come out sweet with only a hint of the naturally bitter undertone left in the vegetables that have them.  </p>\n<p>Doing vegetables this way is really fun and goes along side lamb or beef roasts or burgers, barbecued steak, roasted chicken or turkey and scrambled eggs — just about everything. Ideally, they need to be eaten right away.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be posting a series of combinations of roasted vegetables and will be putting this introduction with each of them hoping it will help everyone become successful at these really delicious and pretty side dishes.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9003-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14287\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9003-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9003-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h2>Roasted Golden Beets, Parsnips, Carrots and Daikon</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<p>The amounts of each of the cut up vegetables will vary depending on the size you buy. A total of 6 cups of vegetables, plus the onions, works well for an 18 by 13 sheet pan. Don&#8217;t overcrowd of the vegetables will steam instead of caramelizing.</p>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>1 red onion, cut in wedges</li>\n<li>1 beet, peeled and cut in small 1/2&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>1 parsnip, peeled and sliced diagonally in 1/4&#8243; slices</li>\n<li>\n<li>parts of different color carrots, peeled and sliced diagonally in 1/4&#8243; slices</li>\n<li>daikon or other radish, peeled and cut in 3/4&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>4 &#8211; 4 1/2 tablespoons avocado oil</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons fresh oregano leaves</li>\n<li>salt</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Place the onion wedges in a small bowl and sprinkle with 1 1/2 &#8211; 2 tablespoons of oil depending on the size of the onion and mix with your fingers to coat all the pieces with oil. Place the remaining vegetables in a larger bowl and drizzle the remaining oil over them, spreading the oil over all the vegetables using your fingers. Spread the onions on a parchment lined sheet pan. Roast them in a 425 degree oven for 8 minutes. Pour the vegetables over the onions and stir them in spreading them evenly over the pan. Sprinkle with salt and return to oven. You&#8217;ll be roasting them anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes depending on the size you&#8217;ve cut them and the tenderness of the vegetable. </p>\n<p>Begin checking for tenderness at 30 minutes. I&#8217;ve found that the best way to do this is by sticking a fork in each kind of vegetable and tasting them. When I think they are done, I give them an additional 5 to 10 minutes keeping an eye on them so they don&#8217;t burn. There&#8217;s a point where the onions have slightly caramelized and the vegetables have the wonderful roasted texture that is the ideal.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8878-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13778\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8878-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8878-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8818-2-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13766\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8818-2-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8818-2-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8981-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13768\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8981-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8981-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/chicken-soup5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13708\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/chicken-soup5.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/chicken-soup5-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_5877.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13725\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_5877.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_5877-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0926.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13727\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0926.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_0926-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_5750.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13732\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_5750.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_5750-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MG_2379.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14177\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MG_2379.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MG_2379-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_1633b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14172\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_1633b.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_1633b-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_0389.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14244\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_0389.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_0389-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_0098.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15040\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_0098.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_0098-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<p>Parsley roots are a common vegetable in the Netherlands, Poland and Germany and is not usually found in the United States. At first, parsley root looks like parsnips but parsnips are cream colored and parsley roots are whiter. The flavor is a cross between celery and a carrot and you cook it like you would a carrot. It can also be mashed with other root vegetables that are good for mashing.<br />\nParsley root is usually smaller and come with their tops still attached like carrots. The leaves are also smaller resembling fine parsley leaves. They can be used like parsley but they are tougher and less flavorful. Parsley roots works well for roasting. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/8556674159_3c70233984_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-13734\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/8556674159_3c70233984_o.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/8556674159_3c70233984_o-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3781937366_cb9f80fafa_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14149\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3781937366_cb9f80fafa_o.jpg 300w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3781937366_cb9f80fafa_o-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelclarke/8556674159/in/photolist\">Photo by michael clarke stuff</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/37884983@N03/3781937366/in/dateposted/\">Photo by Market Manager</a></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9003-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14287\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9003-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_9003-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Some notes on roasting vegetables&#8230;<br />\nRoasted vegetables are a wonderful sweet and savory taste experience. After trying many different combinations of vegetables, I&#8217;ve found that the trick to mastering roasting is for each vegetable to be cut to the right size so they will be tender at the same time and not having to keep them all cooking because one is not tender yet. After some experimenting, I found that daikon radishes (white and purple and probably green too), parsnips, carrots and sweet potatoes all consistently cook fine when cut no more than an inch by a half and inch. Beets, rutabagas, kohlrabi and turnips are the ones that need to be cut no more than a half an inch. If it all goes right, the onions are slightly caramelized and all the vegetables come out sweet with only a hint of the naturally bitter undertone left in the vegetables that have them.  </p>\n<p>Doing vegetables this way is really fun and goes along side lamb or beef roasts or burgers, barbecued steak, roasted chicken or turkey and scrambled eggs — just about everything. Ideally, they need to be eaten right away.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be posting a series of combinations of roasted vegetables and will be putting this introduction with each of them hoping it will help everyone become successful at these really delicious and pretty side dishes.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8781-2-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14132\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8781-2-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8781-2-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h2>Roasted Carrots, Parsnips and Radishes</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<p>The amounts of each of the cut up vegetables will vary depending on the size you buy. A total of 6 cups of vegetables, plus the onions, works well for an 18 by 13 sheet pan. Don&#8217;t overcrowd of the vegetables will steam instead of caramelizing.</p>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>parts of different color carrots, peeled and sliced diagonally in 1/4&#8243; slices</li>\n<li>2 small parsnips, peeled and sliced diagonally in 1/3&#8243; slices or cut in 3/4&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>part of a white or purple daikon radish, peeled and cut into 3/4&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>yellow or red onion, sliced in wedges</li>\n<li>4 &#8211; 4 1/2 tablespoons avocado oil</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons fresh oregano, chopped fine</li>\n<li>salt</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Place the onion wedges in a small bowl and sprinkle with 1 1/2 &#8211; 2 tablespoons of oil depending on the size of the onion and mix with your fingers to coat all the pieces with oil. Place the remaining vegetables and oregano in a larger bowl and drizzle the remaining oil over them, spreading the oil over all the vegetables using your fingers. Spread the onions on a parchment lined sheet pan. Roast the onions in a 425 degree oven for 8 minutes. Pour the vegetables over the onions and stir them in spreading them evenly over the pan. Sprinkle with salt. Return to oven. You&#8217;ll be roasting them anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes depending on the size you&#8217;ve cut them and the tenderness of the vegetable. </p>\n<p>Begin checking for tenderness at 30 minutes. I&#8217;ve found that the best way to do this is by sticking a fork in each kind of vegetable and tasting them. When I think they are done, I give them an additional 5 to 10 minutes keeping an eye on them so they don&#8217;t burn. There&#8217;s a point where the onions have slightly caramelized and the vegetables have the wonderful roasted texture that is the ideal.</p>\n<figure><img

      "rendered": "<p>Some notes on roasting vegetables&#8230;<br />\nRoasted vegetables are a wonderful sweet and savory taste experience. After trying many different combinations of vegetables, I&#8217;ve found that the trick to mastering roasting is for each vegetable to be cut to the right size so they will be tender at the same time and not having to keep them all cooking because one is not tender yet. After some experimenting, I found that daikon radishes (white and purple and probably green too), parsnips, carrots and sweet potatoes all consistently cook fine when cut no more than an inch by a half and inch. Beets, rutabagas, kohlrabi and turnips are the ones that need to be cut no more than a half an inch. If it all goes right, the onions are slightly caramelized and all the vegetables come out sweet with only a hint of the naturally bitter undertone left in the vegetables that have them.  </p>\n<p>Doing vegetables this way is really fun and goes along side lamb or beef roasts or burgers, barbecued steak, roasted chicken or turkey and scrambled eggs — just about everything. Ideally, they need to be eaten right away.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be posting a series of combinations of roasted vegetables and will be putting this introduction with each of them hoping it will help everyone become successful at these really delicious and pretty side dishes.  </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9327-3-753x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-14109\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9327-3-753x1024.jpg 753w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9327-3-221x300.jpg 221w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9327-3-768x1045.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 753px) 100vw, 753px\" /></figure>\n<h2>Roasted Sweet Potato, Turnip, Carrot and Radishes</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<p>The amounts of each of the cut up vegetables will vary depending on the size you buy. A total of 6 cups of vegetables, plus the onions, works well for an 18 by 13 sheet pan. Don&#8217;t overcrowd of the vegetables will steam instead of caramelizing.</p>\n<ul> </p>\n<li> 1 (orange, butter, white or purple flesh colored) sweet potato, yam, or stoke (<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/types-of-sweet-potatoes-to-eat_us_563bb2bde4b0411d30701b0d\">kinds of sweet potatoes</a>) peeled and cut in 3/4&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>1 small or part of a large turnip, peeled and cut in small pieces</li>\n<li>1 small or part of a large rutabaga, peeled and cut in small pieces</li>\n<li>parts of different color carrots, peeled and sliced diagonally in 1/4&#8243; slices</li>\n<li>1 bunch of radishes, large ones cut in wedges and then in half, small ones sliced in half</li>\n<li>1 small to medium onion, sliced in wedges</li>\n<li>4 &#8211; 4 1/2 tablespoons avocado oil, divided</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>\n<li>salt</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Place the onion wedges in a small bowl and sprinkle with 1 1/2 &#8211; 2 tablespoons of oil depending on the size/amount of onion and mix with your fingers to coat all the pieces with oil. Place the remaining vegetables in a larger bowl and drizzle the remaining oil over them spreading the oil over all the vegetables with your fingers. Spread the onions on a parchment lined sheet pan. Roast the onions in a 425 degree oven for 8 minutes. Pour the vegetables over the onions and stir them in spreading them evenly over the pan. Sprinkle with salt. Return to oven. You&#8217;ll be roasting them anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes depending on the size you&#8217;ve cut them and the tenderness of the vegetable. </p>\n<p>Begin checking for tenderness at 30 minutes. I&#8217;ve found that the best way to do this is by sticking a fork in each kind of vegetable and tasting them. When I think they are done, I give them an additional 5 to 10 minutes keeping an eye on them so they don&#8217;t burn. There&#8217;s a point where the onions have slightly caramelized and the vegetables have the wonderful roasted texture that is the ideal.</p>\n<figure>\n<img

In fact, daikon is a Japanese word that means “big root.”<br />\n&#8220;Daikon radish &#8230; contains high amounts of potassium, vitamin C and phosphorus – nutrients that are essential for good health. &#8230; They&#8217;re actually loaded with vitamin A, essential for eye health, and vitamin C – more than the root, actually. They also provide beta-carotene, sodium, iron, phosphorus and calcium.&#8221; <a href=\"https://foodfacts.mercola.com/daikon.html\">Mercola.com</a> Daikon has many health benefits that you can read about on Dr. Mercola&#8217;s site.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8333-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13379\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8333-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_8333-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<p>To make these very delicate and pretty julienned daikon and carrots, you will need a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kuhn-Rikon-Julienne-Protector-Stainless/dp/B0000CEWJD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1528164039&#038;sr=8-1-spons&#038;keywords=julienne+peeler+kuhn+rikon&#038;psc=1&#038;linkCode=sl1&#038;tag=cooandkat-20&#038;linkId=896dfe2bf52ab38e537be9f8655f5efa\">julienne peeler</a>.

      "rendered": "<p>Some notes on roasting vegetables&#8230;<br />\nRoasted vegetables are a wonderful sweet and savory taste experience. After trying many different combinations of vegetables, I&#8217;ve found that the trick to mastering roasting is for each vegetable to be cut to the right size so they will be tender at the same time and not having to keep them all cooking because one is not tender yet. After some experimenting, I found that daikon radishes (white and purple and probably green too), parsnips, carrots and sweet potatoes all consistently cook fine when cut no more than an inch by a half and inch. Beets, rutabagas, kohlrabi and turnips are the ones that need to be cut no more than a half an inch. If it all goes right, the onions are slightly caramelized and all the vegetables come out sweet with only a hint of the naturally bitter undertone left in the vegetables that have them.  </p>\n<p>Doing vegetables this way is really fun and goes along side lamb or beef roasts or burgers, barbecued steak, roasted chicken or turkey and scrambled eggs — just about everything. Ideally, they need to be eaten right away.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be posting a series of combinations of roasted vegetables and will be putting this introduction with each of them hoping it will help everyone become successful at these really delicious and pretty side dishes. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_8176-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13142\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_8176-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_8176-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h2>Roasted Carrots, Kohlrabi and Baby Broccoli With Garlic Scapes</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<p>The amounts of each of the cut up vegetables will vary depending on the size you buy. A total of 6 cups of vegetables, plus the onions, works well for an 18 by 13 sheet pan. Don&#8217;t overcrowd of the vegetables will steam instead of caramelizing.</p>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>2 purple or green kohlrabi, peeled (use a knife), and cut into small 1/2&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>parts of different color carrots, peeled and sliced diagonally in 1/3&#8243; slices</li>\n<li>3 baby broccoli (peel stalk with a carrot peeler, cut into 2&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>small or medium yellow or white sweet onion, sliced in wedges</li>\n<li>1 cup of 1 1/2 &#8211; 2&#8243; garlic scape pieces</li>\n<li>3 1/2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon avocado or olive oil, divided</li>\n<li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>\n<li>1 1/2 tablespoon chopped rosemary</li>\n<li>salt</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Line a sheet pan with foil or parchment paper. Place kohlrabi, carrots and baby broccoli pieces in a medium bowl and onions in another bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 tablespoon of oil over the onions and mix with your hands to spread the oil over all the pieces. Spread the onions on the prepared cookie sheet and bake in a 425 degree oven for 8 minutes or until the edges start to brown. Mix 1 teaspoon olive oil with the scape pieces in a small bowl and set aside. Measure 2 tablespoons oil into a small bowl and add the garlic and rosemary and mix. Pour mixture over the kohlrabi, carrots, and baby broccoli stalks and mix with hands to coat all the pieces. Place the scales and baby broccoli tops in another bowl and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of oil. Spread the kohlrabi, carrots, and baby broccoli stalks among the cooked onions. Sprinkle with salt. Roast for 10 minutes, remove from oven and add the garlic scapes and baby broccoli tops, stir with a nylon spatula to reposition and turn the vegetables over and return to oven for an additional 20 minutes until lightly browned and making sure the kohlrabi is very tender and sweet by removing one with a fork and tasting it. This is high heat. Keep an eye on it so they don&#8217;t burn.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_8147-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone

      "rendered": "<p>Purple kohlrabi is now in season at Whole Foods! If you don&#8217;t yet know about this vegetable, you are in for a treat. I&#8217;ve been watching for them ever since I bought them last time and discovered how special and very tasty this vegetable is. According to the produce man the season will last from one week to a month. He says they sell out fast because of their growing popularity. </p>\n<p>Kohlrabi, &#8216;German turnip,&#8217; is a biennial vegetable. It is a member of the cabbage family along with broccoli, cauliflower, kale, collard greens, and Brussels sprouts. The bulbous part is actually the swollen stem of the plant. Uncooked it tastes like a sweeter milder version of broccoli stems, and just like broccoli stems you need to peel off the tough outer skin because it&#8217;s very fibrous. The inside of the &#8216;bulb&#8217; is denser than its broccoli counterpart so when it&#8217;s cooked the texture can almost remind you of white potatoes and you can make a puree with it like you can with cauliflower. Like rutabaga, kohlrabi can be very woody. The smaller &#8216;bulbs&#8217; are better.</p>\n<p>For foodies around the world this alien-looking but beautiful vegetable of many varieties, both pale green and purple, is valued for both its many ways of being cooked — steamed, sautéed, stir fried, roasted, boiled and turned into veggie burgers, stuffed and baked, thinly sliced and made into chips, cut up for salads or slaws or to make &#8216;french fries,&#8217; spiraled into &#8216;noodles,&#8217; and put into soups and stews — and for its nutrition. Kohlrabi&#8217;s nutrients include copper, potassium, manganese, iron, and calcium, and vitamin C, B-complex vitamins, vitamin A, and vitamin K. It&#8217;s high in dietary fiber and antioxidant compounds.</p>\n<p>Some notes on roasting vegetables&#8230;<br />\nRoasted vegetables are a wonderful sweet and savory taste experience. After trying many different combinations of vegetables, I&#8217;ve found that the trick to mastering roasting is for each vegetable to be cut to the right size so they will be tender at the same time and not having to keep them all cooking because one is not tender yet. After some experimenting, I found that daikon radishes (white and purple and probably green too), parsnips, carrots and sweet potatoes all consistently cook fine when cut no more than an inch by a half and inch. Beets, rutabagas, kohlrabi and turnips are the ones that need to be cut no more than a half an inch. If it all goes right, the onions are slightly caramelized and all the vegetables come out sweet with only a hint of the naturally bitter undertone left in the vegetables that have them.  </p>\n<p>Doing vegetables this way is really fun and goes along side lamb or beef roasts or burgers, barbecued steak, roasted chicken or turkey and scrambled eggs — just about everything. Ideally, they need to be eaten right away.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be posting a series of combinations of roasted vegetables and will be putting this introduction with each of them hoping it will help everyone become successful at these really delicious and pretty side dishes.  </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_7854-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13014\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_7854-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_7854-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<h2>Roasted Kohlrabi and Radishes</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<p>The amounts of each of the cut up vegetables will vary depending on the size you buy. A total of 6 cups of vegetables, plus the onions, works well for an 18 by 13 sheet pan. Don&#8217;t overcrowd of the vegetables will steam instead of caramelizing.</p>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>3 purple or green kohlrabi, peeled (use a knife), and cut into 1/2&#8243; cubes</li>\n<li>2 bunches radishes, tops and tails trimmed off, and cut in half</li>\n<li>1/2 large yellow onion, sliced</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons avocado or olive oil, divided</li>\n<li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon chopped rosemary</li>\n<li>salt</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Line a sheet pan with foil or parchment paper. Place kohlrabi and radishes in one bowl and onion in another bowl. Sprinkle 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil over the onions and mix with your hands to spread the oil over all the pieces. Spread the onions on the prepared cookie sheet and roast in a 425 degree oven for 8 &#8211; 10 ten minutes or until the edges start to brown. In the meantime measure the remaining oil into a small bowl and add the garlic and rosemary and mix. Pour mixture over the kohlrabi and radishes and mix with your fingers to coat all the pieces. Spread the kohlrabi and radishes amoung the onions turning the radishes cut side down. Sprinkle with salt. Roast for an additional 30 &#8211; 40 minutes or until lightly browned. Test the kohlrabi by removing one with a fork and tasting it to see if it&#8217;s tender and sweet. This is high heat so keep an eye on them so they don&#8217;t burn.</p>\n<p>For an additional side dish, kohlrabi greens are similar to collard greens and kale and can be cooked. Cut the leaves off either side of the stem and place them in a steamer basket. When tender, top with chopped garlic sautéed in butter and sprinkle with salt. Kohlrabi greens are very mild tasting but fibrous and can take longer to cook than collard green and kale.</p>\n<figure><img

Place the pieces of leaves in small batches in a salad spinner. This way they will be completely dry and each chip is evenly drying out and becoming crisp as they bake in the oven. Place them in a large bowl. Sprinkle them with the oil and using finger massage the oil over the front and back of each piece. Sprinkle with salt and garlic powder and half the cheese and again using your fingers spread spices and cheese evenly over each of the pieces. Place the pieces on a parchment paper lined large cookie sheet, opening up any pieces that are folded and keeping the pieces separated so they touch but don&#8217;t overlap. Sprinkle with Sunny Paris and remaining cheese. If there are any clumps, move them with your fingers so everything is evenly spread out. </p>\n<p>Place in a 300 degree* oven. After 10 minutes, rotate or turn the cookie sheet around so the chips are in a different place in the oven. (There may be places in your oven that are hotter than others and if some of the chips are in that hot spot they may cook faster.) At 20 minutes, turn the chips over and return to oven for 5 more minutes, checking to make sure they aren&#8217;t getting too brown. The total cooking time is 25 minutes in my oven. When done, remove from oven and let cool for 3 minutes. As they cool they will get crisper. </p>\n<p>Mastering the cooking time for your oven makes all the difference with making kale chips. The cheese and spices will brown and this is okay but if the rest of the kale turns brown the chips won&#8217;t taste good. They will start deep green, then as they start to get very dry and crisp they turn olive green, then brown and burnt. The sweet spot is right at the end of being dark green and just a hint of olive. If you try one after they have cooled and the chips are partly crisp and partly chewy, you can return them and cook them longer.  </p>\n<p>* Cooking at a low setting makes it easier not to overcook them. If you would like them to to be done faster, you can set the oven at 350 degrees and it will only take 15 minutes, turning half way through and starting to check on them at 12 minutes. You will need to really keep an eye on them as they will go from not cooked enough to burnt very quickly at the higher temperature.</p>\n<figure><img

      "rendered": "<p>After eating the wrong way for many years, the anti-inflammatory Paleo (AIP) and Paleo diets are a big step in the right direction to healing the gut, and the brain, getting the whole body functioning properly, and bringing a body to its ideal weight. The research done by Paleo advocates and various health professionals and nutritionists has resulted in the truth about the various foods and what is right for each individual person so they can heal. We didn&#8217;t need to stay away from butter. We just needed butter from cows that are eating grass out in the field like they used to. Western medicine has made a lot of mistakes. The food companies have made a lot of mistakes. Teachers are rising up and people are becoming educated so they can heal from what has happened to us.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://paleoleap.com/the-many-virtues-of-butter/\">PaleoLeaps.com</a> is an very helpful resource for  eating healthy with a lot of Paleo recipes. The following is from their post on the &#8220;Many Virtues of Butter&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;&#8230;butter {from grass fed cows} is a high-quality cooking fat rich in Vitamin K2 and healthy fats that help reduce inflammation, improve gut health, and even protect against weight gain.&#8221; </p>\n<p>&#8220;Vitamin K2/&#8217;Activator X&#8217;</p>\n<p>Once upon a time in Cleveland, Ohio, there was a dentist called Weston A. Price who was really interested in the nutritional underpinnings of health. To make a long story very short, he traveled all around the world and documented the diets of traditional cultures with very low rates of tooth decay and cavities. Then he came home and did experiments on his patients until he had isolated some of the foods he thought were particularly important for dental health.</p>\n<p>One of the nutritional observations he made was the existence of some substance called “Activator X:” it sounds like a science project from the next Captain America movie, but it’s actually a nutrient that helps the body use other vitamins to strengthen bones and teeth. Weston A. Price determined that it was present in butter (among other foods, like bone marrow and fish eggs), but didn’t know much else about it.</p>\n<p>Today, we think Activator X is probably Vitamin K2. You can read all about Vitamin K2 here, but here are the highlights:</p>\n<p>Vitamin K2 helps your bones use calcium properly, so it ends up in your skeleton where they belong (and not, say, in your arteries where it doesn’t belong and where it causes dangerous plaques). Vitamin K2 is also important for other vitamins, like A and D – Dr. Price called it an “activator” because it helps your bones use those vitamins. So it’s important for bone health and for heart health.<br />\nYou can make it from Vitamin K1 (that’s the “vitamin K” in vegetables) but the conversion is inefficient.<br />\nYour gut flora can make it themselves, but most people can’t get enough just from that.<br />\nInstead of trying to convert K1 to K2 yourself, it’s much easier to let the cow do it. Unlike you, a cow has four stomachs – digesting tons of plant roughage is exactly what they were designed to do. The cow eats grass rich in K1 and converts it to K2, and the K2 is present in the milk. The fattier the dairy product, the more concentrated the K2, so butter is exactly what you want to be eating to get the full benefits.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://paleoleap.com/the-many-virtues-of-butter/\">Link to read the excellent post on PaleoLeap.com website.</a></p>\n<p>This recipe is from Aunt Lesley, a wonderful cook.</p>\n<h2>Buttery Carrots and Rutabaga</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>equal amounts of sweet and flavorful carrots, cut in 1&#8243; slices</li>\n<li>and rutabaga, cut into 1/2&#8243; pieces or larger if soft (Some rutabaga can be tough and woody. If you have one that is difficult to cut, you should replace it because it&#8217;s not going to get tender no matter how long you let it cook.)</li>\n<li>butter (Kerrygold grass fed cows)</li>\n<li>salt, if desired (pepper is not good on this dish)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Steam carrots and rutabaga until tender then pulse in batches in a food processor leaving them a little chunky not pureed. Stir in butter, and salt if desired.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_7640-768x1024-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full

      "rendered": "<p>A couple weeks ago on my way to an appointment I was going down Chain Bridge Road in Vienna, Virginia, and passed by the most beautiful fall display I&#8217;d ever seen. I turned around at the next opportunity to go back to look at it. It was DePauls Urban Farm, a family owned and operated nursery with lovely home decorations and local produce and specialty foods. Everything was wonderfully arranged and it felt so nice just to walk around and look at everything. </p>\n<p>Grandpa and Grandma Raymond and Blanche DePaul lived in the charming home on the property starting in 1922. At that time is was a horse farm. After the horse business needed to be moved to a larger location, Cox Farms used the DePaul property for many years as a produce and plant stand before closing and consolidating everything to their 116 acre working farm in Centerville. In addition to a market with their own label and other local foods, they have  farm animals, huge slides, Easter egg hunts and hay rides for children. Because Cox Farms had been so successful in Vienna, as they moved on the next generations of DePauls decided they would continue with the nursery and produce stand adding a few new ideas of their own. They are very talented and have made it a very special place. </p>\n<p>Inspired by the visit, this salad was made with the honey and apples sold at DePaul&#8217;s Urban Farm. Chopped kale salads are very healthy and have been very popular for awhile now. Most grocery stores are carrying ready made kale salads that include a creamy dressing which are tasty but like most bottles dressing, not that healthy.  I did a post with kale and cabbage with fresh cherries and pumpkin seeds a few years ago. Brussel sprouts was a new edition to the store bought salads and I felt it was time for a new version. This one, flavored with a hint of rosemary and orange peel, would be delicious as a side to a turkey dinner, and leftover cold turkey pieces on the salad would also be great.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_7570-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-15990\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_7570-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_7570-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h2>Holiday Kale Salad With Creamy Rosemary Dressing</h2>\n<h2>Salad</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul> </p>\n<li>5 large kale leaves, center rib removed and chopped</li>\n<li>16 ounces brussel sprouts, sliced</li>\n<li>1/2 small green cabbage, sliced</li>\n<li>diced unpeeled apples</li>\n<li>grated raw sweet potato</li>\n<li>sliced sweet onion</li>\n<li>dried cranberries</li>\n<li>toasted pecan pieces</li>\n<li>orange zest, sliced in small pieces</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Arrange kale, brussel sprouts and cabbage in a bowl or on a large platter. individual dishes.

It&#8217;s light and delicious. Store it in the dark and use up within a month.<br />\n**If you are using coconut milk without guar gum, when you open the can you will see that the creamed coconut meat will be separated from the coconut water. Heating it will enable you to blend the two together to make the milk. To make the dressing you will need to make a slightly warm dressing, measuring the heated coconut milk and adding it to all the other ingredients which have been slightly warmed in a saucepan, then shaking them together in a jar or bottle. </p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_8326.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large

Place them on the counter and spread the oil in the middle of each piece, leaving a 3&#8243; border without any oil on it. Mix all ingredients together using a fork. Lay mixture on one of the parchment papers and spread it into a rectangle using greased fingers. Lay the other parchment over the mixture and use a rolling pin to smooth the top. You want it to be 1/8&#8243; and 1/4&#8243; thick for cashew meal and and 1/8&#8243; if using almond flour. Remove paper and using a knife trim and refit mixture to make straight sides and replace paper and smooth out with rolling pin. Place on the cookie sheet and remove the top paper. Using a pizza cutter, make five scores going each direction without cutting all the way through. </p>\n<p>Bake in a 325 degree oven for 15 minutes. Turn the oven off and let dry out for 15 &#8211; 20 minutes until lightly browned. Keep anele on them so they don&#8217;t get too dark. If using cashew meal, they can be a little dark. The almond flour crackers are nicer with just a little browning. You can remove the outer crackers breaking them off where the scores were made and return the rest to the oven if they are getting too brown.

      "rendered": "<p>Coconut and chia seeds have been main staples of peoples in the world because of the many nutrients they provide. Coconut has been so important to the Asian Pacific community it has been called  the “tree of life.” And equally revered for their life giving properties, the chia seeds were named “chia” meaning “strength” by the Mayans. This pudding is primarily made up of the two superfoods, coconut and chia seeds, both of which provide fats that are especially beneficial for brain health.</p>\n<p>When we eat fats, they are broken down into glucose, a type of sugar, providing energy for our bodies. Our brains use 20% of our daily energy input. It’s main fuel is glucose. Brain cells can’t store energy and will only live a few moments without it which is why even it you intervene in a brain stoke early, the damage to the cells can leave a person very debilitated. Coconut oil and human breast milk are the two significant sources of easily broken down medium-chained triglycerides (MCTs) that the liver can break down into ketones that readily cross the blood-brain barrier providing instant energy to the brain if glucose is not readily available at any given time of the day. Alzheimers is sometimes called type 3 diabetes because the brain cells have become insulin-resistant and die because they don’t get the glucose they need. Coconut oil is being researched to see if this back-up energy would prevent or slow down both Alzheimer’s and dementia.</p>\n<p>This &#8220;tree of life&#8221; is good for cardiovascular health, digestion, and inflammation, and it is an excellent source of minerals that are important for regulating the body, and, because of its other healing properties, coconut is used in skin products. </p>\n<p>The chia plant grows natively in South America. The seeds have a history of being a dietary staple because just 2 tablespoons of the seeds provide 11 grams of fiber, 4 grams of protein, 9 grams of fat (5 of which are Omega-3s), a significant amount of calcium, manganese, magnesium, and phosphorus, as well as some of the zinc, vitamin B1, B2, and B3, and potassium that our bodies need. </p>\n<p>Chia seeds release glucose slowly so there is a steady supply of sugar in the blood rather than spikes and deficiencies. Three other benefits chia seeds offer the brain is their antioxidants which protect the brain from free radicals, a complete protein with nine essential amino acids to keep your mood stable and your brain working well. We&#8217;ve been all made aware that there is a &#8216;good&#8217; (HDL) cholesterol that removes the bad (LDL). But you don&#8217;t hear too much about the role cholesterol plays in the body&#8217;s cells. Among a number of structural things cholesterol does, it secures the protein in our cells needed for cells to communicate with each other and it adds firmness and integrity to the plasma membrane of the cells of our bodies preventing it from becoming overly fluid. Chia seeds have Omega-3 which the body makes into the DHA fatty acids that is also part of the structure of cell membranes enabling it to function properly. </p>\n<p>Because they are involved in the integrity of the cells of our body, fats are critical components to anti-disease and anti-aging. </p>\n<h2>Vanilla Chia Pudding</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 can coconut milk (melted and blended)</li>\n<li>1 cup water</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons maple syrup (or honey, agave syrup or stevia to taste)</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>\n<li>7 tablespoons black chia seeds</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>If you purchased coconut milk without gar gum, the coconut meat will be separate from the water and, unlike the cream floating to the top of un-homogenized milk, this can&#8217;t be fixed by shaking it. Pour the content of the can into a small sauce pan and warm over very low heat until the lumps have melted, then blend in a NutriBullet or blender until creamy. Pour into a bowl and add the water, sweetening, vanilla and chia seeds. Whisk, let rest for 10 minutes and whisk again or use a fork to break up any large lumps. Leave in a bowl or spoon into serving dishes and chill for at least 2 hours or until pudding consistency. </p>\n<p>If you have chilled the pudding in serving dishes, decorate them with fruit.

      "rendered": "<p>If you are watching your carbs or are having a guest over for dinner who is watching their carbs, this is a real treat.</p>\n<p>As I was looking at recipes for a cauliflower pizza crust, most of them had you pulse the cauliflower in a food processor, steam it, then put it in towel or cheesecloth and squeeze it dry. So when I ran across a Chef Buck&#8217;s video  where he grates the cauliflower and puts it in a hot dry skillet for 8 to 10 minutes to let off steam, I was intrigued. Also most recipes call for a soft cheese in the crust and he said to use a hard cheese. He called it the &#8220;Best Cauliflower Pizza Crust&#8221; and he said it would really taste like pizza. So I gave it a try and we all took a bite and said, &#8220;Wow!&#8221;  </p>\n<p>The link to his video is below. He uses a hand grater but I used a food processor with a grater attachment which he also said you could use. His dry skillet method is simpler and not as messy. I plan to try using the food processor pulse method rather than grating because it would be simpler and less messy as well.</p>\n<p>Having made this a few times now, I realized that the most important thing is the thickness. If it is over 1/3&#8243;, it gets doughy. I made it too thick by packing the measuring cup too tight and I&#8217;ve also made it too thin by under filling the measuring cup. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myfoodchannel.com/cauliflower-pizza-crust/\">http://www.myfoodchannel.com/cauliflower-pizza-crust/</a></p>\n<h2>Cauliflower Pizza Crust</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients for 1  10&#8243; pizza</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2 cups grated cauliflower florets (fill the measuring cup so there are no spaces but don&#8217;t pack it too tight or the crust will be too thin or too thick and &#8216;doughy)</li>\n<li>1 cup freshly shredded parmesan cheese, asiago or other hard cheese</li>\n<li>1 egg</li>\n<p>You can add a little salt, garlic powder and oregano to flavor the crust if you don&#8217;t have these flavors in your sauce or topping.\n</ul>\n<p>Sauce Ideas</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hunts Tomato Sauce with basil and oregano or Trader Joe&#8217;s Pizza Sauce</li>\n<li>pesto sauce</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Topping Ideas</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mozzarella cheese</li>\n<li>cut up pepperoni</li>\n<li>cooked regular or spicy Italian sausage (remove casing and break into small pieces to cook)</li>\n<li>sliced mushrooms cooked with garlic in butter and lightly salted</li>\n<li>fresh basil leaves</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Grate the cauliflower using a food processor grating attachment if you have one. If you grate the stems there will be some larger pieces that you will want to remove. Heat cauliflower in a dry skillet. It will give off steam. Do this for 8 &#8211; 10 minutes without browning it. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Beat egg in a bowl. Add the cheese and cooled cauliflower and mix together to form a ball. </p>\n<p>Cut a piece of parchment paper (a must, or pizza will stick to pan) to fit a large cookie sheet. Place balled cauliflower onto parchment paper and spread out into a 10&#8243; round &#8216;crust&#8217; keeping the crust under 1/3&#8243; (1/2&#8242; is too thick), pushing the edges in with a fork so that the thickness is all uniform, the edges as the same as the center. This is so the edges won&#8217;t burn.    </p>\n<p>Place crust into a 400 degree oven for 20 &#8211; 25 minutes or until the crust had firmed up and is browning. Remove from the oven, add toppings, return to oven and cook another 10 minutes.  </p>\n<p>Remove pizza from oven. Slide the parchment with the pizza on to a wood cutting board. Let cook slightly, then cut into slices with a knife or pizza cutter.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7285-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12332\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7285-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7285-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7305-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12335\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7305-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7305-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7303-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12334\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7303-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7303-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7310-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12336\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7310-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7310-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7319-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12337\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7319-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7319-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7324-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12338\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7324-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7324-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7328-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12339\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7328-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7328-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_6610-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12359\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_6610-1.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_6610-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></a><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_3653.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12360\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_3653.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_3653-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7329-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12340\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7329-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7329-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7344-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12351\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7344-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_7344-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n",

Heat the oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add meatballs and cook, turning continuously, until cooked on all sides and throughout. Meatballs are better in this dish if they are light in color and tender. Turning them continuously will cause them to be grey and not browned. Remove meatballs to a heated dish, cover and keep warm.</p>\n<h3>Sauce</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>4 tablespoons butter</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons flour or brown rice flour</li>\n<li>1 15.5 ounce can Swanson&#8217;s Beef Broth</li>\n<li>1 cup heavy cream</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon whole or regular Dijon mustard</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Add the butter and flour to the skillet and stir, cooking until lightly brown. Slowly stir in the can of beef broth and the cream. Add the Worcestershire Sauce and mustard and simmer until it starts to thicken. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper. Add the meatballs and simmer for 2 minutes.  </p>\n<p>Serve over cooked noodles or rice.</p>\n<h3>Easy Brown Rice</h3>\n<p>To cook rice, fill a saucepan with a tight fitting lid three quarters full with water and bring to a boil. Rinse the desired amount of rice with water using a sieve. Once the water is boiling, add the rice. Let the rice boil uncovered for 35 minutes, then remove from heat and drain all the water out. Put the lid on the saucepan and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove lid, sprinkle the rice with a half teaspoon of salt and fluff the rice with a fork. </p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7156-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"img_7156\" width=\"600\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12247\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7156-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7156-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7202.jpg\" alt=\"img_7202\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12204\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7202.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7202-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MG_7988.jpg\" alt=\"_mg_7988\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12175\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MG_7988.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MG_7988-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MG_8007.jpg\" alt=\"_mg_8007\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12174\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MG_8007.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MG_8007-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7215.jpg\" alt=\"img_7215\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12207\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7215.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7215-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7225.jpg\" alt=\"img_7225\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12202\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7225.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7225-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MG_6251.jpg\" alt=\"_mg_6251\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12186\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MG_6251.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MG_6251-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7229.jpg\" alt=\"img_7229\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12201\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7229.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7229-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7222.jpg\" alt=\"img_7222\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12208\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7222.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7222-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n</figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7226.jpg\" alt=\"img_7226\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12203\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7226.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7226-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7169-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"img_7169\" width=\"700\"  class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-12194\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7169-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7169-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Fennel is another member of the antioxidant greens family. It&#8217;s stocks are topped with feathery green leaves that produce seeds. You can buy bottle of the seeds dried in the seasoning isle at the store. I was first introduced to the seeds when I asked a butcher for his recipe for Italian sausage. The recipe included parmesan cheese and fennel seeds and no Italian meatball should be without them. It has a very surprising licorice flavor. I like to crush the seeds with a mortar and pestle before adding them to the meat. </p>\n<p>Only a few years ago was I introduced to the very odd looking fresh fennel bulb with its feathery tops. On a few occasions I have asked people at the farmer&#8217;s markets how they like to use them, and most have said in salads. I played with it a little and it did add a fun licorice taste but I wasn&#8217;t in like with it. I also saw a woman at Whole Foods loading a bag with fennel bulbs and I had to ask. She told me that she cuts them up and puts them in the roasting pan along side chicken. I went home and tried that too. Still not it. Then another year past and I saw a recipe for sautéed fennel and leeks. By this time I had figured out how to cut the bulb up pretty well. Both leeks and fennel take a little practice to cut up properly. I cooked them until they were tender and some of the pieces of leeks were just a little brown. It wasn&#8217;t a very attractive dish because of the lack of color, but the flavor was wonderful. The combination of fennel and leeks was like cooking mushrooms with garlic and wanting to put it on everything, which I do. Add garlic to this dish if you want to. Salmon sounds next on the list to flavor with fennel and leeks. We&#8217;ll see how that goes!<br />\nEnjoy! </p>\n<h2>Chicken Tenders With Fennel, Leeks, Broccoli and Mushrooms</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 cup brown rice</li>\n<li>3/4 to 1 lb of chicken tenders, tendons removed</li>\n<li>salt</li>\n<li>pepper</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons flour (opt.)</li>\n<li>1 1/2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>\n<li>1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil*, divided</li>\n<li>1 fennel bulb (stalks and fronds cut off), slivered</li>\n<li>1 leek, sliced, light part only</li>\n<li>8 &#8211; 10 broccoli florets </li>\n<li>5 &#8211; 6 shiitake mushrooms, sliced</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>To cook rice, fill a pot three quarters full with water and bring to a boil. Rinse the rice using a sieve. Once the water is boiling, add the rice. Let the rice boil uncovered for 35 minutes, then remove from heat and drain all the water out. Put a lid on the pot and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove lid, sprinkle the rice with a half teaspoon of salt and fluff the rice with a fork.  </p>\n<p>While rice is cooking, sprinkle chicken tenders with salt and pepper. If using flour, spread it on a dish and roll the tenders in the flour until covered. Heat a half a tablespoon of butter and a half tablespoon olive oil. Add chicken tenders and cook 3 minutes each side until lightly browned and cooked all the way through. Set aside and keep warm. </p>\n<p>Add remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and oil to pan and sauté fennel, leeks, broccoli and mushrooms, until tender. </p>\n<p>Spoon rice into a serving dish and lay chicken tenders over the rice and surround with the vegetables.</p>\n<p>*Trader Joe&#8217;s Trader Grotto&#8217;s Sicilian (cold pressed) Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a blend of three olives from Sicily, packaged in Italy in a beautiful bottle. It&#8217;s light and delicious.

Place asparagus and carrots sticks along the sides of the salmon. Place the garlic slices, sweet pepper strips and red onion slices on the salmon. Drizzle everything with the oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper and fresh thyme.  Seal the foil packets. Set packets on a cookie sheet and bake in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes. Fold the foil underneath along one side. Using a wide spatula, slide fish and vegetables off the foil onto a bed of  rice.</p>\n<h3>Easy Brown Rice</h3>\n<p>To cook rice, fill a saucepan with a tight fitting lid three quarters full with water and bring to a boil. Rinse the desired amount of rice with water using a sieve. Once the water is boiling, add the rice. Let the rice boil uncovered for 35 minutes, then remove from heat and drain all the water out. Put the lid on the saucepan and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove lid, sprinkle the rice with a half teaspoon of salt and fluff the rice with a fork.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/baby-kale.jpg\"

You&#8217;ve probably heard that you need to eat organic foods to lessen the amount of toxins coming into your body, but you may not have asked why you need to detox yourself of the ones that do get in. Inflammation is one of the reasons why you want to get toxins out of your body. </p>\n<p>Our body fights illnesses with an inflammatory response, which is a good thing, but our diets can cause the body to be in a constant state of inflammation, damaging it and leading to disease. Living in a toxic world is causing chronic inflammation. Eating foods we are allergic to that we are not aware of can keep our body in a state of inflammation. Foods high in sugar and saturated fats creates inflammation. Dairy products can also cause an inflammatory response. Having smaller amounts of quality poultry, meat and fish along with eating a mostly plant based diet has been shown to dramatically help with inflammation.  </p>\n<p>Vegetarian and vegan meals, where the protein comes from the combination of beans and whole grains, are delicious comfort foods. If you have the time to soak and then sprout the beans for 2-3 days in a sprouting jar, they are easier to digest and your body get more protein from them. Also the round grains like quinoa, sorghum, teff, millet and amaranth, have more protein than the other grains.</p>\n<h2>Mexican Black Beans and Quinoa</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2/3 cup onions, diced</li>\n<li>1 anaheim pepper, diced (or chili pepper of your choice, anaheims are mild)</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon avocado oil, grape seed or light olive oil*</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon cumin</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1 cup water or chicken broth</li>\n<li>1 1/2 cups sprouted beans or 1 (15 oz) can black or red beans, drained and rinsed</li>\n<li>1 can diced tomatoes</li>\n<li>kernels cut off 2 ears of corn</li>\n<li>3/4 cup quinoa or Super Grains (a 365 Whole Foods Market product made with quinoa, buckwheat and millet)</li>\n<li>cilantro</li>\n<li>avocado</li>\n<li>green onions</li>\n<li>grated cheese (optional)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Sauté onions and peppers in oil for 5 minutes.

Sauté the onions and garlic until soft. Keep the heat at medium so they don&#8217;t brown. Add the Vermouth and cook until liquid is reduced in half. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. To the butter in the bowl add the herbs, lemon rind, lemon juice and sprinkle with salt and pepper. When butter has softened and onion mixture is at room temperature, stir the two mixtures together to make a paste. </p>\n<p>Pound the chicken breasts to 1/2 inch thick and cut in half to make four cutlets. Heat sauté pan and add a little butter and oil. Cook chicken for 4 minutes on each side or until there is no pink in the middle. Ice the hot chicken with the herbed butter paste and let it melt.  </p>\n<p>Served with a white sweet potato and <a href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2013/05/28/sauteed-spinach/\"‎>sautéed spinach</a>.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6138.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6138\" width=\"600\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10725\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6138.jpg 2683w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6138-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6138-767x1024.jpg 767w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2683px) 100vw, 2683px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6164.jpg\" alt=\"parsley\" width=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10765\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6164.jpg 485w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6164-227x300.jpg 227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/sweet-potatoes4.jpg\" alt=\"sweet potatoes4\" width=\"500\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10771\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/sweet-potatoes4.jpg 486w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/sweet-potatoes4-228x300.jpg 228w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4224.jpg\" alt=\"summer flowers\" width=\"500\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10769\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4224.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4224-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6161.jpg\" alt=\"thyme\" width=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10766\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6161.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6161-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><a href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6150.jpg\"><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6150.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken with Herbed Butter\" width=\"500\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10775\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6150.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6150-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ven-green-onion3.jpg\" alt=\"ven green onion\" width=\"500\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10779\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ven-green-onion3.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ven-green-onion3-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6078.jpg\" alt=\"sunflowers\" width=\"500\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10777\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6078.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6078-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MG_4476.jpg\" alt=\"flowers on table at Farmers Market\" width=\"500\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10772\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MG_4476.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MG_4476-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_61551.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6155\" width=\"700\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10755\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_61551.jpg 2736w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_61551-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_61551-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2736px) 100vw, 2736px\" /></figure>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>At the farmers market this morning I was buying some berries and asked the farmer if his farm was organic or sustainable. He said everything they do is &#8220;natural.&#8221; Then he told me something organic farmers do that I hadn&#8217;t heard of before. It was a &#8220;natural&#8221; practice that has been around for a long time. In addition to adding garlic and other natural bug repellents to their sprays and they use &#8220;bug warfare.&#8221; He told me that ladybugs are territorial and he releases them into the berry plants to guard against the bugs that eat the berries.</p>\n<p>I came home and googled &#8220;bug warfare&#8221; on the internet. Lady bugs are small enough to crawl inside curled leaves where aphids hide. Using them to get rid of aphids in crops has saved billions of dollars of food in the last century alone. </p>\n<p>In a New York article, &#8220;Entomological Warfare: Fighting Bugs With Bugs,&#8221; ladybugs were sent into Central Park to eat the eggs of a destructive moth. After the ladybugs were sent in it had also been suggested by an organic gardner, with an environmental science degree from Staten Island Community College, that they send in praying mantis which would take care of any eggs that were missed and had become caterpillars.</p>\n<p>I remember putting marigolds around my garden to keep out animals and spraying soapy water on the plants but there is a lot more to the study of organic gardening than I had any idea about.</p>\n<p>Berries are high in anti-oxydents and the other superfood I was shopping for today was kale. I love kale salads, but cooked kale has always been something I ate because it was good for me, not because I liked it. This recipe, however, actually tastes good. It is an adaptation of a recipe I ran across in <em>Eating Well</em> magazine&#8217;s most recent issue. Their&#8217;s called for sprinkling the kale after it cooked with 2 tablespoons white flour before adding 1 1/2 cups reduced fat milk, then heat until it thickens. Instead it can be thicken with cheese. This would be a gluten free, no carb version verses their low fat version.</p>\n<h2>Creamed Kale With Leeks</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2 tablespoons avocado oil or light olive oil*</li>\n<li>1 large leek, dark parts removed, cut in quarters and sliced</li>\n<li>1 large bunch (about 12 cups) curly kale, sliced thin</li>\n<li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>\n<li>1 1/4 cups half and half</li>\n<li>1/2 cup grated gruyère cheese</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Heat the oil in a large skillet. Sauté leeks for one minute. Add the kale, garlic, salt and pepper and 1/4 cup water and let cook on low heat for 15 minutes or until kale is tender, adding additional water as needed to keep kale from browning.

Mix the sugar and spices in a small bowl and rub on the top of the salmon. Heat the oil in an oven proof skillet. Place salmon rub side down in skillet. Let it sizzle for 2 minutes or until nicely browned. Turn salmon over and place in a 350 degree oven for 12 -15 minutes depending on the thickness of the salmon.</p>\n<p>Serve on a bed of rice (recipe below).</p>\n<p>If you like your fish fully cooked, you want it to reach the point where it&#8217;s no longer solid and is flakey when you test it with a fork. Don&#8217;t over cook or it will be tough.</p>\n<p>If your fish comes with skin, it can be left on. However, there is a grey layer of the fish that may have a taste that bothers you. I prefer to remove the skin so I can remove all of this grey layer of the fish.<br />\n*Trader Joe&#8217;s Trader Grotto&#8217;s Sicilian (cold pressed) Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a blend of three olives from Sicily, packaged in Italy in a beautiful bottle. It&#8217;s light and delicious. Store it in the dark and use up within a month.</p>\n<h3>Easy Brown Rice</h3>\n<p>To cook rice, fill a saucepan with a tight fitting lid three quarters full with water and bring to a boil. Rinse the desired amount of rice with water using a sieve. Once the water is boiling, add the rice. Let the rice boil uncovered for 35 minutes, then remove from heat and drain all the water out. Put the lid on the saucepan and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove lid, sprinkle the rice with a half teaspoon of salt and fluff the rice with a fork. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6056.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6056\" width=\"500\" height=\"640\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10639\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5931-1.jpg\" alt=\"ingredients for glazed salmon\" width=\"500\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10613\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5931-1.jpg 768w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_5931-1-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_60571.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6057\" width=\"500\" height=\"640\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10635\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6075.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6075\" width=\"500\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10623\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6075.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6075-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6055.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6055\" width=\"500\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10624\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6055.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6055-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6070.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6070\" width=\"500\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10625\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6070.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6070-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/asparagus.jpg\" alt=\"asparagus\" width=\"500\" height=\"640\"<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6057.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6057\" width=\"500\" height=\"640\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10628\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6059.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6059\" width=\"500\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10629\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6059.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6059-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n</figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6041-3.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_6041 3\" width=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10715\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6041-3.jpg 2736w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6041-3-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_6041-3-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2736px) 100vw, 2736px\" /></figure>\n",

I&#8217;m going to start with a couple paragraphs from a post last year (<a title=\"Nutritious Gluten-Free Sandwich Bread\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2014/06/17/nutritious-gluten-free-sandwich-bread/\">Nutritious Gluten Free Sandwich Bread</a> June/2014)  and then share what he said to me.</p>\n<p>There isn’t any one diet that is right for everyone but finding the right balance of the proteins, fats, grains and sugar (carbohydrates or &#8216;carbs&#8217;) you consume is right for most people. It’s not difficult to understand what this balance is for your body once you start thinking about it and paying attention to how you feel.</p>\n<p>When you set out to lose weight, you are asking your body to go into its fat storage. There are two things that have caused there to be too much stored fat and that will keep you from achieving your goal. One is if you are eating the wrong amounts of grains and sugar. Grains and sugars are converted by the body into fat and excessive carbohydrates will be added to the stored fat. The second thing is too many calories. Only eating nutritious food doesn’t make it okay to eat as much healthy grains, organic fruit, nutritional sugars – such as honey, maple syrup, agave syrup and coconut sugar – as you would like to eat. You have to have carbohydrates. Your brain can’t think without sugar. The carbs released from grains and nuts release slowly into the bloodstream and keep your energy level. So if you go on a low carb diet and are not getting enough healthy carbs, you will suffer the same cravings and tired symptoms as you did when you were eating too many carbs and you will give up on the new diet. It’s a balance you are trying to find for your body.</p>\n<p>The cardiologist said to focus on the trigger that takes place between your body using some of the stored fat for its energy or using only the carbs you are eating. He said the body will always go for the carbs if they are there but when there isn&#8217;t enough the trigger flips and it starts to use the stored fat. Notice it doesn&#8217;t go for the fat you just ate. Low fat diets didn&#8217;t work because that&#8217;s not how the body works. The focus is on whether it&#8217;s going to use stored fat or the carbs you just ate. This doesn&#8217;t mean you can eat three avocados, a cup of nuts, or too much of any fat because these added calories will become stored fat so you are paying attention to how much fat you are eating in a day, but it&#8217;s not what you need to be focussed on.  </p>\n<p>To get your body to flip the switch to using some of the stored fat you want to get rid of, you are going to have some carbs at breakfast, less for lunch and no more carbs for the rest of the day, making sure to have a healthy snack like a small handful of nuts mid afternoon so your blood sugar stays okay. The doctor recommended that dinner be just protein and leafy green vegetable, like spinach and kale, as a salad or hot vegetable. </p>\n<p>Figuring out the correct amount of carbs is the trick to finding the balance that is right for your body whether you are losing weight or just want to be healthy. You can&#8217;t cut back too much on carbs. You need complex &#8220;good&#8221; carbs — whole grains, vegetables, beans, legumes — in your diet for energy, digestion, metabolism, sleep, fiber, brain and nervous system function (<a href=\"http://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-food/benefits-of-complex-carbs-and-the-best-ones-to-eat/\">www.onegreenplanet.org &#8220;Here&#8217;s Why You Need Complex Carbs&#8221;</a>). As far as the carbs you eat while dieting, cut back on simple sugars as much as you can, including the healthy ones, and only get your sugar from complex carbohydrates.</p>\n<p>A great way to maintain your weight and as part of a nutritious diet is to eat a lot of salads. As of this post, there are 32 salads on this website to give you all kinds of ideas for feeling your best. Enjoy!</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_5750.jpg\" alt=\"Rainbow Cole Slaw\" width=\"700\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10471\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_5750.jpg 2736w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_5750-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_5750-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2736px) 100vw, 2736px\" /></figure>\n<h2>Rainbow Cole Slaw</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>red cabbage, sliced thin</li>\n<li>English cucumber sliced thin</li>\n<li>green pepper, sliced thin</li>\n<li>red pepper, sliced thin</li>\n<li>jicama, sliced thin</li>\n<li>carrots, sliced thin</li>\n<li>green onions, sliced thin</li>\n<li>red and golden beets, sliced thin, steamed and chilled</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Arrange raw vegetables on a plate and beets on the side.

      "rendered": "<p>Soup is really healthy, low calorie and good for the soul especially if you make it yourself from scratch. It&#8217;s quite easy just a little messy dealing with the bones. After a roasted chicken dinner, place the bones in double plastic bags and put in the refrigerator or in the freezer if you don&#8217;t want to make it right away. Save all the drippings or juices from the pan and some of the chicken. These can be frozen too. </p>\n<p>A little note from the Mayo Clinic website. &#8220;There&#8217;s no cure for the common cold. But if you&#8217;re sick, chicken soup may help you feel better. Researchers say that chicken soup acts as an anti-inflammatory and temporarily speeds up the movement of mucus through the nose. This relieves congestion and limits the amount of time viruses are in contact with the lining of your nose. Plus, soup and other liquids help loosen congestion and prevent dehydration.&#8221;  </p>\n<h3>Chicken Vegetable Soup</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1 onion, diced small</li>\n<li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced or chopped very small</li>\n<li>5 crimini mushrooms, diced small</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon avocado oil or light olive oil*</li>\n<li>2 carrots, diced</li>\n<li>2 stalks of celery, diced</li>\n<li>1 zucchini,diced (sliced zucchini blossoms are also wonderful in this soup)</li>\n<li>1 handful of fresh green beans, trimmed and cut into 1/4 inch pieces</li>\n<li>kernels from 2 ears of corn</li>\n<li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon oregano, roll to a powder with palms of hands</li>\n<li>chicken stock (below)</li>\n<li>leftover juices from roasting chicken, chilled and fat removed</li>\n<li>1 cup cooked rice</li>\n<li>1 1/2 cups leftover roasted chicken, cut or torn in small pieces</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Sauté onions and mushrooms in the oil for 5 minutes. Add remaining ingredients except the rice and chicken. Bring to boil, reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes or until vegetables are soft. Add rice and chicken. Heat and serve.<br />\n*Trader Joe&#8217;s Trader Grotto&#8217;s Sicilian (cold pressed) Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a blend of three olives from Sicily, packaged in Italy in a beautiful bottle. It&#8217;s light and delicious.

Bring to a boil and watch for scum floating to the top and skim it off (if you have a really quality bird, there won&#8217;t be any) Then lower heat and simmer gently for one to two hours, skimming off any more particles that come to the surface. Strain the stock using a large pasta strainer into a large pot or bowl and throw the bones and vegetables away. Cool the stock or continue with recipe. If you are making it ahead of time and refrigerate it, the fat will rise to the top and is easy to remove.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_5676.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken Vegetable Soup\" width=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10391\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_5676.jpg 2736w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_5676-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_5676-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2736px) 100vw, 2736px\" /></figure>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>During a recent visit to the farmers market, I spotted a vegetable cut in half lying on a crate. It had caught my eye because it was a light green on the outside and bright magenta on the inside, and also because I&#8217;d never seen it before which happens a lot at the farmers market. I looked around to see which bin this beautiful vegetable had come from so I could find out what is was. The bin was close by and there was a woman there filling a bag full of them. The sign said &#8220;watermelon radish.&#8221; I asked her about them and she said she loved them and bought a big bag them every week. They tasted &#8220;buttery&#8221; she said then and told me to peel them, slice them thin and make a salad with a lemon, oil and salt and pepper dressing. Something new to try. How fun!</p>\n<p>I returned the radish that had been cut in half to the bin where it belonged, took a picture and filled up a bag with the radishes. I walked a little further and another farmer had some very pretty chidori kale, which I&#8217;d also never seen before, and I thought, &#8216;I wonder if you can eat this raw in a salad. The colors of these two vegetables would make a great pair for a picture.&#8217; After I finished the rounds and the market, I took them home to try out the new salad.  </p>\n<p>As I washed the radishes, I was so grateful I had run into someone who knew what to do with them because I probably wouldn&#8217;t have thought to peel them. I followed the woman&#8217;s instructions and then got the kale leaves ready. I had picked up some butter lettuce because it is also very pretty and I had also been buying these perfect looking, wonderful little tomatoes every week. </p>\n<p>Everything tasted as good as they looked. The kale was the perfect choice and the butter lettuce. The contrast of their contrasting textures was great. The radishes were surprisingly mild and slightly sweet and, yes, buttery. So delicious I understood why the woman was buying a whole bag very week. Whoever would have thought a radish could taste so amazing! And I would not have wanted to miss out on the lemon in the dressing. It was just right.</p>\n<p>Watermelon radishes are also known as Rooseheart or Red Meat. They are an heirloom Chinese Daikon radish, a member of the Brassica (mustard) family along with arugula, broccoli and turnips – lots of antioxidant nutrition.</p>\n<p>The decorative kale that you see in professional landscaping and <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em>, and used as a garnish like parsley, is chidori kale. It&#8217;s a slightly tougher but very edible and tasty. If you can&#8217;t find it, use the medium green curly kale.</p>\n<h2>Watermelon Radish Salad</h2>\n<h3>Salad Ingredients</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>butter lettuce and curly kale, broken into pieces</li>\n<li>Persian or English cucumber, sliced</li>\n<li>sweet white onion or red onion, cut in slivers</li>\n<li>tomatoes, cut into bite sized pieces</li>\n<li>watermelon radishes, peeled and sliced</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dressing Ingredients</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>lemon, cut in wedges</li>\n<li>light olive oil</li>\n<li>salt and pepper</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Arrange salad ingredients on plate.

Buy some pH strips at the health food store and do the test first thing in the morning before you&#8217;ve eaten anything and see if your body has the good alkaline level range of 6.5 to 7. It&#8217;s been reported that cancer cells need an acidic environment in order to survive and multiply.

      "rendered": "<p>Once upon a time nouvelle cuisine was the step away from classic cooking but now it seems anything goes. This soup is venturing out into the foodie world where recipes can get a little strange sounding as many foodies like things that are very different, or as tastespotting.com (probably the number one website for foodies) puts it, they invite you to submit &#8220;weird&#8221; recipes. I don&#8217;t normally go for the really crazy mixtures but this one from <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> (December 27,2014) sounded interesting so I decided to try it and see what happened.</p>\n<p>The title of the article by Russ Parsons was &#8220;Simple, Satisfying Soups&#8221; and the first thing I learned was that &#8220;simple&#8221; for these creative chefs doesn&#8217;t mean quick. For so many soups, you throw everything into a pot and turn it on. This recipe takes some time and it felt like I was making courses. To avoid messing one up with another, I kept everything organized in bowls.</p>\n<p>As it turned out the recipe was fun to make, and the end result was very pretty as well as true to form — different — and I was surprised by being so pleased with it and actually really enjoying it. The browned onions were chewy with was the most strange but the wonderful taste of browned onions was somehow enhanced by the bisque. I tried to see if I could pick up each of the tastes, like the dill in the pesto, and it made me appreciate the professional tasters on the chef competition shows who can pick out all the flavors and tell you if they are in the right balance. </p>\n<p>The original recipe in the <em>Times</em> was called &#8220;Spiced Vegetable Soup&#8221; a fusion of cuisine ingredients that are mostly Mediterranean. It was a vegetarian recipe that had you add enough water to cover the vegetables, which I changed to chicken broth. The pesto was called an &#8220;herbed oil&#8221; and it was made with pistachios. I substituted pinenuts and recategorized it as a pesto because of its consistency. The original recipe also called for 3 teaspoons hot pepper paste, such as harissa, which is a North African and Middle Eastern condiment made with a Tunisian (North African) pepper which are often smoked, garlic, olive oil and spices, like cumin, coriander, caraway and mint. Tomatoes and rose petals are also common ingredients in harissa. If you would like to make this bisque spicy, this is added along with the cinnamon, cumin and smoked paprika. You can find smoked paprika at Penzey&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>Next time I may use pistachios and try throwing in a sweet potato in place of a russet for more nutrition and a little sweetness.   </p>\n<h2>Mediterranean Bisque</h2>\n<h3>Bisque</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>3 tablespoons avocado oil or olive oil</li>\n<li>2 large onions, diced</li>\n<li>3 cloves garlic</li>\n<li>2 cups (2-3 depending on size and the amount of dark leaves) chopped white and light green part of leeks</li>\n<li>5 cups (one medium) butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into small cubes</li>\n<li>5 cups (about 3 medium) russet or boiling potatoes, unpeeled, cut into small chunks</li>\n<li>4 teaspoons cumin</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>\n<li>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>\n<li>3 teaspoons hot pepper paste like harissa (optional, see introduction)</li>\n<li>4 cups fresh chopped tomatoes</li>\n<li>5-6 cups chicken broth or water</li>\n<li>3 teaspoons salt</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>\n<li>2 cans garbanzo beans, divided (3/4 cup for topping), and juice reserved (about 2 cups juice)</li>\n<li>2 cups zucchini (2 medium), diced small</li>\n<li>feta cheese</li>\n<li>pesto (below)</li>\n<li>onion topping (below)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Heat the oil.

Just slice a large amount of the vegetables (except for the kale) and place them in a large plastic bag lined with paper towels, and they will keep for up to a week.</p>\n<p>Making a salad like this as one of your meals every day gives you a powerhouse of nutrition. Watermelon seeds are high in protein (28%), the amino acids that are the building blocks for new proteins that are made in your body. Along with the olive oil, watermelon seeds are a source of good fat to regulate your cholesterol levels. The normal range for HDLs (good cholesterol) is 50-60. The normal range for LDLs (bad cholesterol) is 60-130 and your triglyceride count should be under 150. Good fats from foods like salmon and sardines, avocados, nuts and seeds, olive and coconut oil, will do two things. They put your body in the optimal range of HDLs (risk of heart disease is helped significantly less when it&#8217;s over 85). And HDLs lower the LDL count because HDLs remove LDLs from the blood.</p>\n<p>Heart disease is a result of inflammation in your arteries and eating the right oils is one component in a healthy diet to avoid heart disease, obesity, diabetes and cancer. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.disclose.tv/news/World_Renowned_Heart_Surgeon_Speaks_Out_On_What_Really_Causes_Heart_Disease/113103#.VRQhohiQ8W0.facebook\">www.disclose.tv/news/World_Renowned_Heart_Surgeon_Speaks_Out_<br />\nOn_What_Really_Causes_Heart_Disease/113103#.VRQhohiQ8W0.facebook</a></p>\n<p>Watermelon seeds are also high in zinc and iron.</p>\n<p>All the vegetables in this salad are the super food cruciferous vegetables full of vitamins, fiber and disease fighting photo-chemicals. </p>\n<h2>Winter Slaw With Sprouted Watermelon Seeds</h2>\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>red cabbage, sliced thin</li>\n<li>green cabbage, sliced thin</li>\n<li>broccoli, sliced thin</li>\n<li>cauliflower, sliced thin</li>\n<li>brussel sprouts, sliced thin</li>\n<li>carrots, sliced thin</li>\n<li>radishes, sliced thin</li>\n<li>kale, sliced thin </li>\n<li>sprouted watermelon seeds (Von&#8217;s carries these) or pumpkin seeds (pistachios are good too!)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>Assemble any choice of the vegetables in a bowl or on a plate.

      "rendered": "<p>Bisque derives its name from the Bay of Biscay that borders France and Spain. It was originally a creamy soup made in France based on a strained broth of seafood. The seafood was <em>bis cuites</em>, &#8220;twice cooked&#8221;. First sautéed, then simmered in wine and seasonings with cream added to it at the end.</p>\n<p>Bisque can also be used to refer to cream-based soups that are pureed in a food processor or food mill that do not contain seafood.</p>\n<p>This broccoli and cauliflower bisque recipe was adapted from a recipe in a little booklet called <em>Healing Soups</em> by Sandra F Frank. She said that it is good for hormonal issues.</p>\n<p>Men and women are both having estrogen levels effected by toxins in  plastic bottles pesticides and commercially raised animal products. Cruciferous vegetables, especially broccoli, contain many nutrients that promote the healthy metabolism of hormones, reducing the negative side effects of excess estrogen.</p>\n<h3>Broccoli and Cauliflower Bisque</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2 tablespoons avocado oil or light olive oil</li>\n<li>1 cup green onion, sliced</li>\n<li>4 teaspoons curry powder</li>\n<li>6-7 cups chicken broth, depending on thickness desired</li>\n<li>4 yukon gold or white potatoes, peeled and cut into small chunks</li>\n<li>4 cups cauliflower florets</li>\n<li>4 cups broccoli florets</li>\n<li>1/2 &#8211; 1 cup half and half</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons fresh chives, sliced</li>\n<li>6 tablespoons Boursin Garlic and Herbed flavored cheese (optional)</li>\n<li>salt to taste</li>\n<li>additional chopped chives for garnish</li>\n</ul)\n\n\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Sauté onions in the oil for 5 minutes. Add curry and cook 30 seconds. Add chicken broth and potatoes, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are tender. Steam florets until tender and chop. Combine half of chopped florets with the stock and cooked potatoes and process in a food processor in batches. Add the remaining chopped florets along with the cream and chives. Stir in the Boursin cheese if using and salt to taste.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4930.jpg\" alt=\"ingredients for broccoli and cauliflower bisque\" width=\"500\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9922\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4930.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_4930-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/good-broccoli-and-cauliflower.jpg\" alt=\"good broccoli and cauliflower\" width=\"500\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9923\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/good-broccoli-and-cauliflower.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/good-broccoli-and-cauliflower-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/med-sz.jpg\" alt=\"med sz\" width=\"700\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9924\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/med-sz.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/med-sz-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Sometimes I pass by an unidentified vegetable or herb many times at the market and I don&#8217;t pay any attention to it. That&#8217;s what was going on with these long green strings actually called &#8216;snake&#8217; beans. I didn&#8217;t know what they were until one morning I was looking around and someone was loading a bunch of the snakes into her bag. I had to ask her what it was and what do you do with it. She said they were long beans and you use them just like green beans. Another lady standing there joined in the conversation. &#8220;My son loves green beans.&#8221; </p>\n<p>So there the both of us were staring at them and deciding whether we wanted to go for it. I mean, they are very strange looking to someone who&#8217;s never cooked them. And the bundles were so big and long and floppy. I read later that they can be  up to 3 feet long. They have a more grandiose name in Latin that better suits them. It&#8217;s &#8216;vina unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis.&#8217;  I decided to go with the green colored beans and not the purple ones, so them would be more &#8216;normal,&#8217; although I&#8217;ve been discovering that when you cook any kind of purple bean, it turns green.</p>\n<p>When I got home, I rinsed them and set them up on the cutting board. Cutting them was so fast and easy compared to regular green beans. No snapping off a million ends. Just hold them in a bundle and cut all the ends, at each end, with one slice. So two slices and they are ready to be cut into your 2&#8243; pieces. &#8216;Where have I been?&#8217; &#8216;This is great.&#8217; I thought. And they tasted great. </p>\n<p>Long beans are fiber rich, good for removal of toxins from the colon and reducing LDL cholesterol levels. They contain a good amount of vitamin C and more vitamin A than the other beans in its legume family.  </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_24861.jpg\" alt=\"cut long beans\" width=\"600\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9903\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_24861.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_24861-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Long Beans, Shallots and Garlic with Toasted Almonds </h4>\n<h4>Ingredients</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>4 cups long beans or green beans, cut in 2&#8243; pieces</li>\n<li>2 large shallots, diced</li>\n<li>2 large garlic, minced</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon grass feed butter (Kerrygold)</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon avocado oil or olive oil</li>\n<li>salt and pepper</li>\n<li>toasted almond slivers or slices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instructions<br />\nBlanche beans for 10 minutes and drain.

This recipe is an adaptation of a pot roast and roasted beets and sweet potatoes hash with a poached egg on top served at Ramos House in San Juan Capistrano. My son was raving about it and his own version he made at home sprinkled with fresh parsley. Google the restaurant and look at the pictures guests have posted on Trip Advisor and Yelp. The dishes are works of art. </p>\n<p>Since I&#8217;m not fond of runny egg yolks, I passed on the poached egg as I created my own version of the recipe. It&#8217;s quite possible I&#8217;m missing out on something really great. So please feel free to mix the meat and vegetables together into a patty shape and top with the egg and sprinkle with a chiffonade of Italian parsley. You can also add an onion cut in slivers to the roasted vegetables. If you use other root vegetables that are tougher like rutabaga or parsnips, cut them smaller so they get tender at the same time as the beets.   </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/med4.jpg\" alt=\"roasted beets and sweet potatoes\" width=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9767\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/med4.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/med4-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Roasted Beets and Sweet Potatoes</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1 purple, red or orange sweet potato or yam\n<li>1 white sweet potato\n<li>1 large red beet\n<li>1 large yellow beet\n<li>avocado or light olive oil\n<li>salt and pepper\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Cut potatoes and beets into desired shape, cutting the potatoes a little smaller than the beets because they take longer to cook. Drizzle with a little oil toss to coat the vegetables evenly. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

      "rendered": "<p>Taste testing all the different kinds of winter squashes has been on my culinary bucket list for a long time. Pumpkin, acorn and butternut squash seem to be everyone&#8217;s favorites and I&#8217;ve been curious if most of the other ones are just used for decoration.</p>\n<p>When speckled swan gourds came to the farmers market a few weeks ago, I decided it was time to start asking some questions. The farmer said that the gourds were strictly for decoration and would last for a very long time. But the others he was selling, people ate. Someone standing there said she was going to try out a kabocha squash and fennel soup recipe she had found. </p>\n<p>After baking a few of them, in addition to pumpkin, acorn and butternut, I only liked the taste of delicata, also called sweet potato squash, which I had fallen in love with a couple years ago. The taste test hadn&#8217;t changed anything for me except to say that I had given some of the others a shot. </p>\n<p>My conclusion was that the classic orange pumpkins are used as much for eating as they are decorating and the rest of these beautiful vegetables fall somewhere in between what they are used for. </p>\n<p>According to wikipedia bisque was a word derived from the Bay of Biscay that borders Spain and France. &#8220;Parts of the continental shelf extend far into the bay, resulting in fairly shallow waters in many areas and thus the rough seas for which the region is known. The Bay of Biscay is home to some of the Atlantic Ocean&#8217;s fiercest weather.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Bisque is a smooth, creamy, highly seasoned soup of French origin, classically based on a strained broth (coulis) of crustaceans. It can be made from lobster, crab, shrimp or crayfish. Also, creamy soups made from roasted and puréed fruits or fungi are sometimes called bisques. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Bisque is also sometimes used to refer to cream-based soups that do not contain seafood, in which the sometimes pre-cooked ingredients are pureed or processed in a food processor or a food mill. Common varieties include squash, tomato, mushroom, and red pepper.&#8221;</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_49142.jpg\" alt=\"Delicata Squash and Sweet Potato Bisque\" width=\"700\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9874\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_49142.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_49142-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Delicata Squash and Sweet Potato Bisque</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2 shallots, chopped</li>\n<li>1 onion, chopped</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons avocado oil or olive oil</li>\n<li>6-8 cups chicken broth</li>\n<li>2 carrots, diced</li>\n<li>1 large celery stalk, diced</li>\n<li>2 delicata squash or butternut (see <a href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2011/11/20/butternut-squash-and-sweet-potato-bisque/\" title=\"Butternut Squash and Sweet Potato Bisque\">Butternut and Sweet Potato Bisque</a> , peeled and diced (about 4 cups)</li>\n<li>2 sweet potatoes or yams, peeled and diced (about 4 cups)</li>\n<li>2 bay leaves</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon thyme</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>\n<li>1 cup whole milk, cream or 1/2 cup full cream coconut milk</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Sauté onion and shallots in the oil for 3 minutes.

Healthiest Foods</strong> website about winter squash:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Winter squash is one of the richest sources of plant based anti-inflammatory nutrients such as omega 3s and beta-carotene, which are important for a strong immune system to help protect against colds and flu.<br />\n&#8220;Although winter squash has long been recognized as an important food source of carotenoids, only recently have research studies documented just how fantastic winter squash can be when it comes to these key antioxidants. For some groups of study participants, winter squash turns out to be the primary food source of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene in the entire diet! For lutein, zeaxanthin, and beta-cryptoxanthin (three other health-supportive carotenoids) winter squash also comes out among the top three food sources in several studies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Seeds from winter squash make a great snack food, just like pumpkin seeds. If you scoop the pulp and seeds from inside the squash and separate out the seeds, you can place them in a single layer on a cookie sheet and lightly roast them at 160-170°F (about 75°C) in the oven for 15-20 minutes. By roasting them for a relatively short time at a low temperature you can help minimize damage to their healthy oils. Linoleic acid (the polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid) and oleic acid (the same monounsaturated fatty acid that is plentiful in olive oil) account for about 75% of the fat found in the seeds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We think about winter squash as a very starchy vegetable—about 90% of its total calories come from carbohydrate, and about half of this carbohydrate is starch-like in its composition. However, recent research has made it clear that all starch is not the same, and the starch content of winter squash brings along with it some key health benefits. Many of the carbs in winter starch come from polysaccharides found in the cell walls. These polysaccharides include pectins—specially structured polysaccharides that in winter squash often include special chains of D-galacturonic acid called homogalacturonan. An increasing number of animal studies now show that these starch-related components in winter squash have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, as well as anti-diabetic and insulin-regulating properties.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Winter squash is a vegetable that might be especially important for us to purchase organic. Recent agricultural trials have shown that winter squash can be an effective intercrop for use in remediation of contaminated soils. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including pyrene, fluoranthene, chrysene, benzo(a)anthracene and benzo(a)pyrene are unwanted contaminants. PAHs are among the contaminants that can be effectively pulled up out of the soil by winter squash plants. When winter squash is planted as a food crop (as opposed to a non-food crop that is being planted between food crop seasons to help improve soil quality), the farmer&#8217;s goal is definitely not to transfer soil contaminants like PAHs up into the food. But some of that transfer seems likely to happen, given the effectiveness of winter squash in mobilizing contaminants like PAHs from the soil. For this reason, you may want to make a special point of purchasing certified organic winter squash. Soils used for the growing of in certified organic foods are far less likely to contain undesirable levels of contaminants like PAHs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&#038;dbid=63</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>I was 16 when I was first introduced to spoon bread. It was at Evan&#8217;s Farm Inn, a restaurant that was located on a farm in Northern Virginia just outside of Washington D.C. Coming from palm trees, concrete and swimming pools in L.A., my first thought as I was landing in a plane over Northern Virginia was &#8220;it&#8217;s so green!&#8221; The Evan&#8217;s Farm Inn property was so beautiful they had weddings there. It was on prime real estate and has been sold now but I&#8217;m sure it holds fond memories to those who had the privilege of going there.</p>\n<p>After enjoying the grounds outside the buildings, as you stepped into the inn, it was a scene right out of the colonial days with old tables and decorative antiques. The food was delicious, but the only thing I clearly remember was the spoon bread. Once your meal was served, the waitresses, dressed in long dresses, aprons and bonnets (like something out of Gone With the Wind), would come in holding large, warm pots wrapped in towels under their arms, and would go around the table and ask you if you would like some spoon bread. Using a large spoon,they would take a scoop of the bread out of the pot and place it on your plate. Unlike cornmeal, it was light and creamy and both salty and sweet. Spoon bread is meant to be an accompaniment to roasted meat or poultry, like you would use English Yorkshire pudding.</p>\n<p>The first printed recipe for spoon bread appeared in a cookbook by Sarah Rutledge in 1847, 14 years before the Civil War. It&#8217;s believed to be of Native American origin called <em>Awendaw</em> or <em>Owendaw</em> making it perfect for a Thanksgiving dinner. </p>\n<p>Scalding milk was something that was done originally to remove possible bacteria from raw milk but it turns out it does several other things for a recipe. When a thickening agent is added to scaled milk, the cooking process goes faster. When the eggs are added, they won&#8217;t curdle. Also there is a subtle change in both the flavor and the texture of the food when the milk is scalded. All three reasons for scalding the milk apply to this recipe.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_8207.jpg\" alt=\"Old Virginia Spoon Bread\" width=\"600\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9549\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_8207.jpg 427w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_8207-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Old Virginia Spoon Bread</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>5 cups whole milk, scalded*\n<li>1 cup cornmeal\n<li>3 tablespoons butter\n<li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n<li>1 tablespoon honey\n<li>3 eggs, separated\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Beat the eggs whites until stiff and set aside. Whisk in the cornmeal into the scalded milk and cook, whisking constantly, for 5 minutes. Whisk in the yolks, then the butter, salt and honey. Fold in the egg whites and pour into a soufflé dish or deep round casserole. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes. When it comes out of the oven, it is very hot. Let sit for 10-15 minutes before serving. It will have puffed up very high in the oven like a soufflé, then will settle down and thicken. </p>\n<p>*Scald milk by heating just to the point where it starts to rise up the pot. Use a tall pan so if you aren&#8217;t watching it, it won&#8217;t boil over the rim and make a mess. Also, if you can feel a film stuck on the bottom of the pan as you begin to use the whisk, pour the milk into a bowl, remove the film from the pan and put the milk back in before continuing the recipe so there&#8217;s no risk of burnt pieces getting into the bread.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MG_2715.jpg\" alt=\"_MG_2715\" width=\"500\"

The practice of eating fruit and cheese along with nuts also dates back to ancient times.

Apples and cheesemaking came to America by European settlers. Now eating a slice of cheese on your apple pie is called eating it New England style.  </p>\n<p>This recipe is a nutritious makeover of a recipe in the original <em>Dolly Put the Kettle On</em> cookbook. The wheat flour was changed to the gluten-free flours. The white sugar became lower glycemic coconut sugar. Avocado or light olive oil is replacing the butter and coconut milk was added to make it moist.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MG_6408.jpg\" alt=\"Gluten-Free Apple and Cheddar Cheese Tea Cakes\" width=\"600\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9662\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MG_6408.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MG_6408-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></a></figure>\n<h3>Gluten-Free Apple and Cheddar Cheese Tea Cakes</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</p>\n<h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1/2 cup brown rice flour</li>\n<li>1/2 cup gluten-free oat flour</li>\n<li>1/4 cup sorghum flour</li>\n<li>1/4 cup millet flour</li>\n<li>1/4 cup hemp flour or buckwheat flour</li>\n<li>1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>3/4 cup coconut sugar</li>\n<li>1/2 cup avocado or light olive oil</li>\n<li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>\n<li>2 eggs, slightly beaten</li>\n<li>1 1/4 cup chopped apples</li>\n<li>2/3 cup grated cheddar cheese</li>\n<li>2/3 cup walnuts, chopped</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instructions<br />\nGrease a muffin pan and set aside.

Agriculture is Somerset&#8217;s major business and it is known for its famous cheeses. Apple orchards were once plentiful and Somerset is still known for the production of a strong cider called ‘scrumpy.’ </p>\n<p>Somerset chicken recipes vary greatly but the sauce always has apple juice or cider in it. Using apple cider gives the dish a stronger apple taste and makes it sweeter. Some recipes include tomatoes giving the dish a very different flavor. Many and perhaps most of the recipes have a rich cream sauce flavored with the cider, mustard and cheese, a company version which sounds so yummy that I will probably be trying out very soon while the fall apples are in season.</p>\n<p>This simple and healthy version of the dish is from my grandparent&#8217;s recipe files. It goes together quickly and is really delicious!</p>\n<p>If you are cutting back on sugar and carbohydrates to lose weight or to watch your blood sugar, you can skip the rice, add some chicken broth and turn it into a Somerset Chicken Stew.</p>\n<h3>Somerset Chicken Rice Bowl</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>4 chicken breasts</li>\n<li>salt and pepper</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon coconut, avocado or light olive oil* </li>\n<li>1 medium onion, cut in slivers**</li>\n<li>8 ounces mushrooms, sliced</li>\n<li>1 red pepper</li>\n<li>1 green pepper</li>\n<li>3 small apples, peeled and sliced</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>\n<li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1 cup plus 3 tablespoons apple juice, divided</li>\n<li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>\n<li>cooked brown rice (recipe below)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Slice chicken breasts diagonally and place in a plastic bag and pound to 3/4” thickness and salt and lightly pepper each side. Heat butter in medium hot skillet and lightly brown chicken on both sides and lay in a casserole. Add the oil to the skillet and the mushrooms and onions. Sauté for 10 minutes until the onions are just starting to caramelize. Add the peppers and cook 3 minutes. Stir in the seasonings, then the apple slices and 1 cup of apple juice. Let simmer 10 minutes. Mix 3 tablespoons of apple juice with 1 tablespoon cornstarch and stir into the skillet. Spoon the apple vegetable mixture over the chicken. Cover loosely with foil and bake in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes.<br />\n*Trader Joe&#8217;s Trader Grotto&#8217;s Sicilian (cold pressed) Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a blend of three olives from Sicily, packaged in Italy in a beautiful bottle. It&#8217;s light and delicious. Store it in the dark and use up within a month.<br />\n**Cut in half through the middle, then in half through the top and the bottom, then in slivers.</p>\n<h3>Easy Brown Rice</h3>\n<p>To cook rice, fill a pot three quarters full with water and bring to a boil. Rinse the rice with water using a sieve. Once the water is boiling, add the rice. Let the rice boil uncovered for 35 minutes, then remove from heat and drain all the water out. Put a lid on the pot and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove lid, sprinkle the rice with a half teaspoon of salt and fluff the rice with a fork. </p>\n<figure><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9525\" src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_41891.jpg\" alt=\"somerset chicken ingredients\" width=\"600\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_41891.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_41891-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9529\" src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/apples.jpg\" alt=\"apples\" width=\"500\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/apples.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/apples-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9499\" src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/med1.jpg\" alt=\"Somerset Chicken\" width=\"500\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/med1.jpg 484w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/med1-226x300.jpg 226w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px\" /><br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9501\" src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MG_5656.jpg\" alt=\"green peppers\" width=\"500\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MG_5656.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MG_5656-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9521\" src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/flowers.jpg\" alt=\"flowers\" width=\"500\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/flowers.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/flowers-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9503\" src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/onions.jpg\" alt=\"onions\" width=\"500\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/onions.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/onions-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9502\" src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_4094.jpg\" alt=\"cameo apples\" width=\"500\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_4094.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_4094-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></p>\n<figure><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9534\" src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MG_64244.jpg\" alt=\"Somerset Chicken Rice Bowl\" width=\"700\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MG_64244.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/MG_64244-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>This recipe is a &#8216;lower&#8217; carb food for maintaining healthy weight and blood sugar levels because it&#8217;s sweetened with honey and is made without the grains which convert into sugar. We tend to do things to the extreme and when you start eating a low carb diet, you may think you need to cut out all sugar. That may be necessary in some cases people but cutting out all grains and sugar is not the right thing to do for most people. Our bodies, including our brains, need the sugar from carbohydrates. The problem has been eating too many carbohydrates cause the body to crave the sugar like an addiction.</p>\n<p>Taking it a step future, the goal of this recipe, like many of the gluten-free recipes on this website, is a balance between the traditional wheat flour and sugar recipes that have little nutrition and overload you with carbs, and recipes that have gone the opposite direction replacing the wheat flour with something that may or may not be good for you, and a sugar substitute that may or may not be good for you. </p>\n<p>Fruit and honey are healthy carbs. To make a cake lower in carbohydrates, this cake is made with coconut flour and almond meal. Coconut flour recipes call for a lot of eggs which has been something that has been sending up a red flag because doctors have been telling people to cut back on eggs because of the cholesterol in the yolks. But just as <em>Time</em> magazine recently told us that butter wasn&#8217;t the problem behind obesity, doctors have also figured out that the cholesterol has not been the problem with what happens to arteries that leads to cardiovascular disease. </p>\n<p>The medical field brought to our attention what they&#8217;ve called &#8220;bad&#8221; cholesterol when they began dealing with arteries that were clogged with cholesterol. As a result they have been taking tests and if a person had a high cholesterol count, they would be told that we were at risk of blockages resulting in heart attacks. But the issue wasn&#8217;t the amount of cholesterol, it&#8217;s the amount of inflammation in the body. No matter what the level, cholesterol will not attach itself to the walls of arteries unless they are inflamed. What doctors had discovered was that cholesterol was attaching itself to inflamed walls acting like a bandage. This is good news for everyone because they have been eating according to misinformation and it&#8217;s being fixed.</p>\n<p>Cholesterol plays several major roles in the body and the vitamin K2 in eggs helps the cholesterol in eggs to be delivered to where it is needed. Cholesterol helps make the membranes of cells. Cholesterol makes the bile acids that work to digest the food in the intestines and it&#8217;s involved in the production of vitamin D and some hormones like estrogen and testosterone. </p>\n<p>Inflammation occurs in the body when toxins damage cells which is called free radical damage. The cells lose an electron and go haywire. Anti-oxidents return the electron counteracting toxin&#8217;s free radical damaged cells. Avoiding  toxins that will cause inflammation is why we don&#8217;t want to breath bad air and second hand smoke and why we try to eat unprocessed and organic foods.</p>\n<p>You will find cakes like these filled with lemon curd or custard and frost it with whipped cream that has been beaten until it is very thick. To keep it lower carb, just fill it with whipped cream which is the very classic sponge cake recipe.</p>\n<h3>Gluten-Free Sponge Cake With Whipped Cream and Fresh Fruit</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1 cup almond meal flour</li>\n<li>1 cup coconut flour</li>\n<li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1 1/2 cups unsalted butter</li>\n<li>1 1/2 cups honey</li>\n<li>8 eggs, slightly beaten</li>\n<li>1 cup coconut milk</li>\n<li>2 teaspoon vanilla</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Grease 3 round cake pans, lined with waxed paper and set aside. Mix almond meal flour, coconut flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl and set aside. Cream butter and honey. Add eggs, coconut milk and vanilla and mix. Add flour mixture and mix until blended. Pour into the prepared cake pan. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes or until  it bounces back when you touch it with your finger. Remove cakes from pans and let cool.</p>\n<p>This cake is very tender and light. I use a very large spatula or two large knifes to move the layers and set them on top of each other. It will fall apart if you use your fingers.</p>\n<p>Make whipped cream frosting using 2 cups whipping cream, 1/4 cup honey and 1 teaspoon vanilla.</p>\n<p>Ice each layer with whipped cream and fresh seasonal fruit. Decorate with fresh mint leaves, grape leaves or other decorative leaves of your choice.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_6225.jpg\" alt=\"strawberries\" width=\"600\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9118\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_6225.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_6225-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_3693.jpg\" alt=\"Gluten-Free Almond and Coconut Cake With Whipped Cream and Fresh Fruit \" width=\"500\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9603\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_3693.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_3693-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3178.jpg\" alt=\"raspberries and blueberries\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9134\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3178.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3178-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_0243.jpg\" alt=\"pluets\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9137\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_0243.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_0243-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n<img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_44011.jpg\" alt=\"peaches\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9138\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_44011.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_44011-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/plums.jpg\" alt=\"plums\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9127\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/plums.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/plums-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><br />\n</figure>\n",

Every week there is a new sign letting us know it&#8217;s the last week for a particular peach and this morning I knew it was time to stock up on them. </p>\n<p>Some of the farmers have samples of all the different tomatoes. They slice them and sprinkled with salt and pepper. If you don&#8217;t know it yet, salt and tomatoes go together like peanut butter and jelly. For this recipe post, I&#8217;ve added just a few more ingredients and not too much lettuce, still wanting to feature beautiful heirloom tomatoes.  </p>\n<p>Turn this salad into a meal by adding chunks of fresh mozzarella cheese or some leftover roasted chicken or baked salmon broken into bite sized pieces. </p>\n<p>The salt myth needs to be shaken up. Sodium is a vital nutrient your body, aiding in digestion, helping maintain fluid balance and cardiovascular function, and it plays an important role in the nervous system, helping neurons send messages to other neurons. Tomatoes are a great way to get the extra salt you need in the summertime to keep hydrated. They taste great with a lot of salt so pass some extra salt around with the salad.   </p>\n<h3>Tomato and Cucumber Salad With Fresh Dill and Basil</h3>\n<h4>Salad Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>good tomatoes in season</l>\n<li>persian cucumbers (for regular cucumbers, remove waxy, bitter peels) </l>\n<li>sweet onion</l>\n<li>fresh dill</l>\n<li>fresh basil</l>\n<li>romaine lettuce (optional)</l>\n<ul/>\n<h4>Dressing Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1/2 cup light olive oil*</l>\n<li>2 tablespoons Coconut Secret Coconut Vinegar</l>\n<li>1 teaspoon honey</l>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</l>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</l>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Shake dressing ingredients in a jar.

Add this fun and pretty recipe to your list. </p>\n<p>A &#8216;tian&#8217; is a mixture of roasted vegetables cooked in a shallow dish, usually with a cheese or au gratin (with a browned bread crumb topping). It derives its name from a large, round, earthenware pot used in Provence, France but as people moved around and recipes changed, a tian has become known as an Italian casserole. This version of a vegetable tian has potatoes which adds a lot to the dish making it very different. Slice the potatoes very thin so they get cooked, and use a waxy type of potato so the slices keep their shape. </p>\n<p>The amounts of the ingredients can be varied.  Add more or less of whatever you feel like, for example, more potatoes and less squash. Use more garlic if you like or use basil or oregano instead of rosemary and thyme. To make it a more low carbohydrate dish, omit the bread crumbs and double the cheese. </p>\n<p>Serve with fried or scrambled eggs, roast chicken, meatloaf or lamb, beef or turkey burgers.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3913.jpg\" alt=\"Summer Vegetable Tian Au Gratin\" width=\"600\"  class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9204\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3913.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3913-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Summer Vegetable Tian Au Gratin</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>5 tablespoons avocado oil or light olive oil, divided</li>\n<li>1 red pepper, sliced into 1/8 thick pieces</li>\n<li>1 onion, sliced in half, then in thin wedges</li>\n<li>3 garlic cloves</li>\n<li>3 zucchini, cut in 1/8&#8243; slices</li>\n<li>2 yellow crookneck squash, cut in 1/8&#8243; slices</li>\n<li>2 small yukon potatoes, sliced very thin</li>\n<li>1 medium or 2 small tomatoes, sliced</li>\n<li>salt and pepper</li>\n<li>1 1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves</li>\n<li>1 1/2 teaspoons fresh chopped rosemary</li>\n<li>1/2 cup parmesan reggiano cheese</li>\n<li>1/2 cup fresh <a title=\"Nutritious Gluten-Free Sandwich Bread\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2014/06/17/nutritious-gluten-free-sandwich-bread/\">bread</a> crumbs</li>\n<li>2 teaspoons butter</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Sauté red pepper, onion and garlic in 2 tablespoons the oil for 5 minutes, spread in the bottom of a casserole, sprinkle with salt and pepper and set aside.

      "rendered": "<p>If you&#8217;ve been passing by the yummy looking dried mango in the bins at the store, you have an excuse now to buy some. It&#8217;s delicious. I&#8217;ve also always loved the taste of dried peaches. The first time I baked with them was to add them to banana bread. That was years ago before I was paying attention to nutrition and the additives in food. Much of the dried fruit that you find out there have sulfites added to preserve them, keeping them from losing flavor and turning dark brown. Sulfites have been used for centuries to preserve food, and they also occur naturally in fermented foods like wine, but there is a lot more found in dried fruit than any other kind of food.</p>\n<p>During this week&#8217;s visit to the farmers market I asked a farmer about sulfites and he said that his company was putting a lot less sulfites in his fruit so if I bought his colorful and flavorful dried fruit, it would be this year&#8217;s crop, recently dried, and it would stay colorful and  flavorful for a short time. Another farmer said that they sulfites in their dried fruit came from being dried over volcanic material. More &#8220;natural&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Both of these options may be a lot better than what you buy at the store but then I tasted samples from a farm near San Francisco. Frog Hollow Farm (http://froghollow.myshopify.com, a great online gift store) sells organic and sulfur-free dried fruit. The peaches were very fresh and amazing. There store has great gift ideas.   </p>\n<h3>Gluten-Free Mango and Peach Tea Cakes</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>1/2 cup dried peaches, cut in to small pieces</li>\n<li>1/2 cup dried mangos, cut into small pieces</li>\n<li>3/4 cup honey</li>\n<li>1/4 cup water</li>\n<li>1/2 cup avocado or light olive oil</li>\n<li>5 large or 4 jumbo eggs</li>\n<li>1 cup canned coconut milk</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>\n<li>1/4 cup chia seeds</li>\n<li>1 cup coconut flour</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Put dried fruit, honey and water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, turn down heat and let simmer 15 minutes.

This is a dinner you can throw together in less than a hour, including shopping if you don&#8217;t have to wait in the check out line very long and assuming you have bread crumbs and pesto in the freezer at home. You can make it gluten free, low carb and it&#8217;s a nice company dish. </p>\n<p>Caprese is a name that can be given to a dish prepared with tomatoes, mozzarella, basil leaves and olive oil — like a caprese salad, a caprese sandwich or caprese pizza — a style originating in Capri, an island in West Italy in the Bay of Naples. </p>\n<h3>Chicken Caprese</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2 chicken breast, slices diagonally and pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>\n<li>1/3 cup (about 3 frozen cubes) pesto (see below)</li>\n<li>4 slices of fresh mozzarella cheese or gruyere cheese</li>\n<li>4 slices of a firm but ripe tomato, peeled</li>\n<li>1 small garlic clove minced</li>\n<li>1/4 cup almond meal or fresh bread crumbs (see <a title=\"Nutritious Gluten-Free Sandwich Bread\" href=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/2014/06/17/nutritious-gluten-free-sandwich-bread/\">Nutritious Gluten-Free Sandwich Bread</a> June/2014)</li>\n<li>avocado oil or light olive oil*</li>\n<li>salt and pepper</li>\n<li>grated asiago and/or parmigiana reggiano (24 month aged parmesan) cheese</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Rub each side of the 4 pieces of chicken with olive oil, sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper and lay in a casserole. Divide the pesto among the pieces and spread over the top. Lay a slice of mozzarella on each one, then a slice of tomato. Drizzle each tomato with a little oil and spread the minced garlic into the oil. Top the tomatoes with the bread crumbs. Bake in a 350 degree oven for 23 minutes. Sprinkle with grated cheese.</p>\n<p>Serve on pasta or rice (recipe below) if desired. For a vegetable, sautéed onions and squash is good with this.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/MG_35801.jpg\" alt=\"pesto\" width=\"600\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4552\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/MG_35801.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/MG_35801-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<h3>Homemade Pesto</p>\n<h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</p>\n<h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2/3 cup pine nuts\n<li>1 cup olive oil\n<li>1  4 ounce box of basil leaves (3 lightly packed cups basil leaves)\n<li>1/4 cup grated parmigiano reggiano cheese\n<li>3 cloves garlic\n<li>1 teaspoon salt\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Put pesto ingredients in food processor and process/pulse just enough so you can still see the pieces of basil and finely chopped nuts.<br />\nPesto can be frozen in an ice cube tray. Once it has hardened, wrap each cube in plastic wrap and toss in a freezer bag. These frozen cubes thaw very quickly.<br />\n*Trader Joe&#8217;s Trader Grotto&#8217;s Sicilian (cold pressed) Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a blend of three olives from Sicily, packaged in Italy in a beautiful bottle. It&#8217;s light and delicious. Store it in the dark and use up within a month.</p>\n<h3>Easy Brown Rice</h3>\n<p>To cook rice, fill a pot three quarters full with water and bring to a boil. Rinse the rice with water using a sieve. Once the water is boiling, add the rice. Let the rice boil uncovered for 35 minutes, then remove from heat and drain all the water out. Put a lid on the pot and let stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Remove lid, sprinkle the rice with a half teaspoon of salt and fluff the rice with a fork. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/beefsteaks.jpg\" alt=\"beefsteaks\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8825\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/beefsteaks.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/beefsteaks-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_5496.jpg\" alt=\"flowers at the farmers market\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8878\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_5496.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_5496-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/basil-cilantro.jpg\" alt=\"basil\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8826\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/basil-cilantro.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/basil-cilantro-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3018.jpg\" alt=\"squash at farmers market\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8836\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3018.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3018-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/garlic.jpg\" alt=\"garlic\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8827\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/garlic.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/garlic-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/roses-on-shelf.jpg\" alt=\"roses on shelf\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8838\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/roses-on-shelf.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/roses-on-shelf-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_36151.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken Caprese\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8828\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_36151.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_36151-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n",

      "rendered": "<p>Gazpacho is a soup made of raw vegetables that is served cold. It originated in southern Spain and is widely eaten in both Spain and neighboring Portugal during the hot summers. It&#8217;s roots are ancient and among a number a theories it may have begun as an Arab soup made with bread, olive oil and garlic that arrived in Spain with the Moors or from Rome with the addition of vinegar. There are many variations now. You can find gazpacho with ham or shrimp, sometimes it will be a puree. I prefer it a little chunky and with just vegetables. Made with V8 juice and garnished with avocado this recipe is really delicious.  </p>\n<h3>Gazpacho</h3>\n<h4>Ingredients</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>5 cups diced beefsteak tomatoes</li>\n<li>1 green bell pepper, cut in small pieces</li>\n<li>1 cucumber, cut in small pieces</li>\n<li>2 stalks celery, cut in small pieces</li>\n<li>1/2 cup shallots, cut in small pieces</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons Italian parsley leaves</li>\n<li>1 1/2 cups V8 juice</li>\n<li>1/4 cup red wine vinegar</li>\n<li>1/4 cup light olive oil</li>\n<li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>\n<li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>\n<li>1 1/2 teaspoons honey</li>\n<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>\n<li>diced avocado for garnish</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Instructions</h4>\n<p>Place the tomatoes in a large bowl. Use a food processor to mince the bell pepper, cucumber, celery, shallots and parsley. Do them separately so you pulse just enough to have minced pieces and not mush. Transfer the vegetables to the large bowl as they get minced. In a smaller bowl mix the V8 juice, vinegar, olive oil, lemon juice, honey, salt and pepper. Pour this over the vegetables and stir. Refrigerate at least 4 hours or overnight to blend the flavors. Garnish with avocado and/or a chiffonade, long thin strips, of fresh basil leaves.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3366.jpg\" alt=\"ingredients for gazpacho\" width=\"600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8729\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3366.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3366-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3007.jpg\" alt=\"garlic\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8723\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3007.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3007-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mimi-tomatoes-and-squash.jpg\" alt=\"mini tomatoes and squash\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8724\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mimi-tomatoes-and-squash.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mimi-tomatoes-and-squash-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_5580-copy.jpg\" alt=\"pretty display\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8725\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_5580-copy.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_5580-copy-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_5561.jpg\" alt=\"peppers\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8726\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_5561.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_5561-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_5245.jpg\" alt=\"avocados\" width=\"500\"  class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8727\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_5245.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/MG_5245-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/good-persian2-55.jpg\" alt=\"persian cucumbers\" width=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8728\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/good-persian2-55.jpg 480w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/good-persian2-55-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3114.jpg\" alt=\"Gazpacho\" width=\"700\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8746\" srcset=\"https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3114.jpg 960w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3114-225x300.jpg 225w, https://write.dollyskettle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3114-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></figure>\n",
